Can New iPads Reinvigorate Apple, Inc.'s iPad Sales? Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) could announce a second-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro as early as next week, Japanese blog Mac Otakara reported (via MacRumors) this week. In addition, Apple is expected to introduce both a 10.5-inch iPad Pro with narrower bezels and an updated version of its 12.9-inch iPad Pro sometime soon.

While new iPads would likely help Apple's iPad segment, will they be enough to help the segment return to growth? Spoiler alert: Probably not.

Declining iPad sales

Declining iPad sales are putting pressure on Apple's tablet segment. Apple's iPad sales in the company's most recent quarter, or its first fiscal quarter of 2017, were down quite sharply from the year-ago quarter. iPad units fell 19%, and iPad revenue fell 22%.

Apple's need for new tablets to help revitalize the segment isn't anything new. iPad sales have been declining for years. For instance, Apple's iPad unit sales and revenue during the entire trailing-12-month period were down about 14% and 11%, respectively. Going further, iPad unit sales have been declining on a trailing-12-month basis since the second quarter of 2014.

So investors shouldn't expect possible new iPads to suddenly reverse this trend. But this doesn't mean investors shouldn't hope for some solid updates to the lineup. Given that Apple already possesses sizable market share in tablet sales in many of its markets, the company needs to keep its iPads fresh to remain competitive.

Notably, there's more reason than recent rumors to believe Apple has some new iPads in the works for a launch in the coming weeks. Not only does Apply typically launch new iPads around this time of the year every year, but Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted during the company's fiscal 2017 first-quarter earnings call (via a Reuters transcript) that there were some key updates on the horizon: "If I sort of zoom out of the 90-day clock and look at it, we've got some exciting things coming on iPad."

Apple remains optimistic about iPad

Despite declining iPad sales and the fact that both Apple's services and Mac segment have grown to represent a comparatively larger portion of Apple's total sales recently, Cook still believes the segment has potential, according to his comments in the company's most recent earnings call.

I still feel very optimistic about where we can take the product. When we look at the number of people buying iPads for the first time, which is a good thing to look at from a point of view of whether things are reaching penetration point or not, the numbers indicate that it's not close to that kind of thing. The customer sat numbers are through the roof. Literally, the customer sat for the iPad Pro is 99%. It's stunning. ... But again, beyond the 90-day clock, I'm very bullish on iPad.

Cook could be right. iPad could still have some room to run. But based on Apple's drawn-out trend of declining iPad sales, investors shouldn't count on it -- even if the company is preparing to introduce new iPads. A Risk for This Apple Inc. Supplier Emerges For years, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) was the sole manufacturer of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A-series applications processors. However, beginning with the A8 system-on-a-chip, Samsung lost that business to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM).

Samsung would win back a portion of the follow-on A9 orders (Samsung and TSMC split those orders, and it is believed that Samsung received a majority allocation), but TSMC won the entirety of the A10 orders.

It is generally believed that TSMC has also won the entirety of the follow-on A11 processor orders. Those chips are expected to be manufactured in TSMC's new 10-nanometer manufacturing technology.

However, a new report from Korean publication ETNews claims that Samsung is "expecting that it can recover Apple's foundry supplies that were taken by Taiwan's TSMC by operating 7-nano production lines."

Samsung's apparent hunger to win back business from TSMC is a clear risk to the latter.

A12 probably isn't at risk, but what about A13?

Samsung went into mass production on its 10-nanometer LPE in the fourth quarter of 2016 and has publicly said that it expects to begin volume production of the follow-on to this technology, known as 10-nanometer LPP, in the fourth quarter of 2017.

Samsung has said that it aims to begin mass production of its 7-nanometer technology in 2018, and given the schedules around 10-nanometer LPE/LPP, I'd guess that Samsung is aiming for late 2018 production start for its 7-nanometer technology.

What this suggests is this: TSMC is unlikely to be at risk of losing A12 business to Samsung as the latter's 7-nanometer technology will be too late to market to support the A12, while TSMC has indicated that it plans to begin mass production on its 7-nanometer technology in the first half of 2018.

It's the potential A13 business that could be at risk from an aggressive push from Samsung.

Don't count TSMC out, though

Samsung seems to be planning some aggressive technical moves with its 7-nanometer technology -- it's reportedly planning to move to a new transistor structure called a Gate-All-Around (GAA) transistor that promises to allow chipmakers to continue to make transistors smaller.

However, TSMC has indicated that in 2019 it intends to roll out a performance-enhanced variant of its 7-nanometer technology.

There are a lot of factors that will drive Apple's decisions of where it plans to manufacture its next-generation A-series processors -- both business and technical -- so trying to guess where Apple will build its next-generation processors is difficult.

It's worth noting, though, that TSMC co-CEO Mark Liu said on the company's Q3 2016 earnings call that he expects TSMC's market share during the 7-nanometer technology generation will be "higher than 10-nanometer" and that TSMC's aim is for each new manufacturing technology to enjoy higher market share than the prior-generation technology.

It'd be hard for TSMC to achieve higher market share in the 7-nanometer generation relative to the 10-nanometer generation if it ends up losing a significant portion of Apple's business to Samsung. This leads me to believe that TSMC is confident that it can maintain its sole-source position at Apple, but only time will tell if that confidence is deserved. Why Isn't Apple Doing Better? Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares have now appreciated bout 30% since Samsung phones started imploding. That's a market cap gain of $150B. The strength of a run in the stock market has lifted the shares as well.

However, what we see from the earnings is not strength. What we can clearly see is Apple reducing r&d and increasing buybacks, to make earnings appear slightly better than they otherwise would be. Buybacks may feel good today, however this is a technology company. Eventually you need innovation, ideas, and new products.

Apple's $5B New Product looks like this:

Is the building necessary to attract tech talent: because Apple is no longer as attractive for young tech engineers?

There are many issues with a $5B new campus for Apple and its surprising you hear so little about it. This is a statement headquarters and might be one of the most expensive corporate headquarters in history.

A statement to the world; we are the strongest, most dominant American company right now. The other companies that built iconic statement corporate headquarters included Sears, Roebuck and Company and Woolworth and Co.

Of course, they were at the peak of their dominance when the buildings were opened. Essentially, both wound up bankrupt and irrelevant thereafter. What I am suggesting is that dominant companies that get fat, lazy, comfortable and stop innovating and can get overtaken by their competitors. It happens.

It's also a huge investment of time and energy to build a gigantic new headquarters that distracts management from running the business and innovating.

The budget for the new spaceship-like headquarters ballooned to a little under $3 billion in 2011 and almost $5 billion by 2013, although at this point it was reported that Apple was looking at ways to trim this by a billion (via Macworld)

Worth noting that costs for the project ballooned by more than $2B. Again, that's shareholder money and its easy to ignore it since things seem fine here with the stock at all-time highs, but it would be a mistake to overlook.

Apple's 175-acre 'Apple Park' opening to employees in April

Amenities include the "Steve Jobs Theater" (opening later in the year), a visitors center (Apple Store, cafe; open to public), secure R&D facilities, a 100K-square-foot employee fitness center, paths, an orchard, meadow and pond.

Let me ask you, could you ever imagine Steve Jobs spending $5B on a new Apple campus full of cushy environs to coddle Apple engineers like a 100,000 fitness center or a movie theater? Does this sound like a young, hungry upstart company? Or is it more indicative of a complacent, overconfident market leader?

Is Apple losing the war for engineering talent?

The reason they need this expensive new building is because they need help attracting talent. Ask yourself if you were a young tech engineer in silicon valley- who would you want to work for? Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Uber, Snapchat (NYSE:SNAP), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), an AI company, or a robotics company. Or would you want to work on the Iphone upgrade?

Innovate or Die:

Here's a better question, What product has Tim Cook and Apple developed in the last 5 years that could pay for this new building? The Apple watch? As an investor, it is important to ask, What do we see on the horizon from Apple that can move the needle?

The tech giant is investing a "fair amount" into R&D, including "future stuff [he] can't talk about." (via CNBC)

The competition for innovation has never been more expensive. Innovation requires talent and engineers who can create great new products. That type of talent has never been more expensive. Amazon , Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook , Uber, are now competing for engineers capable of creating new technological breakthroughs for the next great gadget or product. Even car companies working on self-driving cars now compete for this type of talent.

Innovation is essential and always has been at Apple. Eventually, investors will require something special and not just Iphone and Ipad upgrade cycles every few years. I have not seen or heard anything coming from Apple (or even from analysts), that will push the needle on innovation in a meaningful way and continue to justify the share price at current levels.

Apple is not strong; Samsung had a temporary disaster

Apple stock on fire from Samsung's flames

According to fresh statistics from IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, Samsung shipped 72.5 million smartphones during the three-month period ending in September, good for 20 percent of the global market. The figure is down 13.5 percent from 83.8 million units shipped in the year ago quarter.

The last time Samsung took only 20 percent of the global market was in the fourth quarter of 2014, back when Apple trailed the Korean tech giant by only 0.16 percent. (via Apple insider)

Considering the extent of the good fortune Apple and the iphone have received due to Samsung's problems, why weren't Apple's results stronger?

This is the best they can achieve when a major competitor is temporarily hobbled from competition? 3% growth.

Samsung will be back and Apple shares have priced in a 28% gain since then, or some $150B in market cap gains. Currently, Apple sports a rich 17 p/e, which is the highest in 5 years.

Is it an enduring competitive advantage that your competitor had a product disaster or is that just luck?

Apple earnings and results:

Q1 2017 results - revenue $78.4B (+3.3% Y/Y, $1.02B above estimates), EPS $3.36 (vs. $3.28 Y/Y, $0.14 above estimates), operating cash flow $27B, share repurchases and dividends $15B (cumulative payments through capital return program $200B+)

Products - iPhone: units 78.29M (+5% Y/Y), revenue $54.378B (+5% Y/Y); iPad units 13.081M (-19% Y/Y), revenue $5.533B (-22% Y/Y), Mac: units 5.374M (+1% Y/Y), revenue $7.244B (+7% Y/Y); Services revenue $7.172B (+18% Y/Y), Other Products [revenue $4.024B (-8% Y/Y).

Operating segment revenues - Americas $31.968B (+9% Y/Y), Europe $18.521B (+3% Y/Y), Greater China $16.233B (-12% Y/Y), Japan $5.766B (+20% Y/Y), Rest of Asia Pacific $5.863B (+8% Y/Y) (via s/a)

Comments from the CEO, Tim Cook on the earnings:

The tech giant is investing a "fair amount" into R&D, including "future stuff [he] can't talk about."

Valuation:

The valuation for Apple is certainly stretched. The share price has screaming higher, due to earnings inflated by Samsung's problems. In addition, buybacks inflate the results as well as strength in the overall stock market.

As this is happening, we see the growth rate of the company slowing, while the median p/e moves higher. Investors are thus paying higher prices for Apple's earnings and receiving a slower, growth company, with less innovation on the horizon. Of course, Samsung will no doubt be back with a more competitive offering.

Technical overview:

The shares are extended beyond the 20 day, 50 day and 200 day moving averages more than at any point in the last 5 years. A pullback is certainly due.

More significant is that as the stock hit new highs recently, it did so on declining volume.

This is never a good sign and shows fading institutional interest in the shares at this level $140.

It's overbought and overpriced near term.

Again, we see a fading interest in the shares at all-time highs.

Conclusion:

Apple is not as strong as investors believe it is.

Apple has gotten lucky due to the misfortunes of Samsung. This was great for Apple and the shares have hit all-time highs on a rising stock market and a temporary boost.

A preference for buybacks over research and development helps the share price but will hurt the company eventually.

The new $5B Apple campus raises questions as to whether Apple is having trouble attracting top tech talent in a competitive market. Without top talent, there is less innovation, and less growth.

All of these issues lead an investor to worry if Apple has become complacent and the recent gains are due more to luck than strength.

SAN FRANCISCO Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc are among more than 60 technology companies that appear to have backed away from the legal fight against U.S. President Donald Trump's controversial travel ban, deciding not to put their weight behind a lawsuit seeking to block the second version of his executive order.

A legal brief filed in federal court in Hawaii on Tuesday on behalf of Silicon Valley companies listed the support of 58 companies, less than half the 127 signatories to a similar brief filed in an appeals court last month after Trump's first executive order banning travel from a number of countries the administration said posed a security risk.

Airbnb Inc, Dropbox Inc and Kickstarter are among the companies that did sign the brief.

Major tech companies that signed on to the earlier effort but not this week included Microsoft Corp, eBay Inc, Intel Corp, Netflix Inc and Twitter Inc.

The lawsuit may succeed despite losing the overt support of such big names. U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu on Wednesday ordered an emergency halt to Trump's executive order that aimed to temporarily bar entry to the United States of most refugees as well as travelers from six Muslim-majority countries. The halt is temporary.

Trump says the ban is necessary for U.S. national security, and called Watson's order "unprecedented judicial overreach."

Tech companies, which generally rely on skilled workers from overseas more than other industries, played a large part in the legal effort to halt the first version of Trump's executive order, which was put on hold by a Seattle judge in early February.

It was not immediately clear why fewer of them signed on to the "friend-of-the-court" brief this time around.

Companies will have an opportunity to join the effort as it moves through the court system, said Robert Atkins, a New York lawyer and co-author of the brief. "We do expect the group to expand."

Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc was in the process of adding its name, a spokesman said.

Box Inc, a file-sharing service, said that although it did not sign the brief, there had been no change to its position.

A Twitter spokeswoman pointed to past company statements opposing Trump's initial travel ban in January but declined to comment further. A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment.

Representatives of Apple, Google, eBay, Intel, Microsoft and Netflix did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

(Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Bill Rigby) Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Holders Might Have a Painful Wait Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) has taken a bit of a breather this month after a terrific run. Apple stock gained 30% just between November and early March, and is up over 50% from late June levels.

The latter run, incredibly, has added about $250 billion to the market value of AAPL stock.

Part of the gains have come from the fact that AAPL was just too cheap, particularly below $100 this summer. But optimism toward the iPhone 8 has boosted hopes that Apple stock can jump-start growth. (The issues at key competitor Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ), including the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, likely have helped as well.)

So the question now for AAPL is when the iPhone 8 is coming   and how much upside might be left from a successful launch and product cycle.

For now, it looks like there s still some gains left for Apple stock   but investors might need to have some patience.

Will the iPhone 8 Move Apple Stock?

At the moment, it appears the iPhone 8 will be launched this fall, according to various reports. But Apple has said little about the launch, leaving a guessing game for observers and investors. Even the name isn t clear: The next phone seems likely to be called the iPhone 8, not the 7S, but that s not assured at the moment.

Most observers are expecting an iPhone 8, rather than a 7S, because the next-gen product will have major changes. The most notable was thought to be a curved OLED screen, but those reports have been questioned of late. Iris recognition, facial scanning, and a larger screen (on a phone of similar dimensions) are all expected to be features of various versions of the phone.

What might be most interesting for Apple stock is the price. On Monday morning, Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal said supplier prices supported a possible $1,000 price for the new iPhone. Other reports of a high-end  Edition  have speculated an ASP over $1,200. Higher prices for iPhones mean higher margins for Apple   and likely a higher multiple for AAPL stock.

Will Investors Buy the Leaks and Sell the News?

The biggest worry ahead of the launch is if there will be a  buy the rumor, sell the news  reaction from investors.

It is clear that some of the optimism over the past few months, in particular, has been driven by consumer reaction to the leaked specs for the new iPhone. Indeed, Apple stock traditionally has been moved almost solely by iPhone sentiment. Sales of other products have been pretty much flat the last four years.

So if there is a large base of investors bidding up the Apple stock price ahead of the iPhone 8, the question then becomes: What might happen in September when the product actually is released?

7 Surprising Metrics Highlight 1 Major Catalyst for Apple, Inc. Stock: Services With the iPhone providing 64% of trailing-12-month revenue at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the tech giant's business is still primarily driven by that segment. But that doesn't mean investors should overlook Apple's other business segments. One is standing out more than ever: the company's App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services.

1. $7.2 billion: In Apple's most recent quarter, quarterly services revenue hit an all-time high of $7.2 billion -- up 18% year over year, handily exceeding Apple's overall revenue growth of 3% and beating growth in any other segment.

But even this growth in Apple's services segment understates how rapidly services revenue is growing. Apple CFO Luca Maestri explained the discrepancy between reported growth and actual segment growth in the company's first-quarter earnings call:

Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago.

2. 9.2%: Apple's services segment is growing as a proportion of total revenue. In the company's most recent quarter, services accounted for 9.2% of total revenue, up from 8% in the year-ago quarter and 6.4% in the same quarter two years ago.

3. 43%: Adjusting for the extra week in Apple's first quarter this year, App Store revenue soared 43% year over year, shattering all previous records. This was driven by growth both in average revenue per paying account and in the total number of paying accounts.

As Maestri was sure to mention, Apple's App Store revenue growth outpaced the overall app industry, and more than doubled 2016 revenue from Alphabet's Google Play store.

Going forward, Maestri believes "the App Store is going to be a significant driver of growth."

4. $3 billion: If you had any doubts about the importance of the App Store to Apple's services segment, wonder no longer: It's critical. Apple said fiscal first-quarter App Store revenue was $3 billion in December alone.

5. $60 billion: Based on the trajectory of developer revenue in 2016, the business of apps is just getting started. Apple's developer community has now raked in $60 billion in earnings, garnering over $20 billion just in 2016.

6. Over 150 million subscriptions: Between Apple's own subscription services and third-party content subscriptions offered through the App Store, the company has more than 150 million paid customer subscriptions.

7. $51 billion: What kind of growth should investors expect from Apple's services segment? The business could double over the next four years, according to Apple management. This would bring annual services revenue to a staggering $51 billion in 2020.

While these figures alone make a great case for investors to pay close attention to Apple's services segment, the very nature of Apple's services themselves justify the segment's importance. Unlike the unpredictable nature of focused product revenue from iPhone, Mac, and iPad, services revenue is more sustainable, stable, and predictable. Further, it's a solid measure of the degree to which a growing number of customers are becoming increasingly invested in Apple's powerful ecosystem of hardware, software, and services. Are Bears About To Maul Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock? Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock is still hovering just below the all-time high it hit this week, although chart technicians warn that tougher times could be just around the corner. Meanwhile, analysts are saying buy, buy, buy, and the news of Berkshire Hathaway s quadrupling-down on the iPhone maker during the fourth quarter seems like endorsement enough.

So are the bears about to take over Apple Inc. (AAPL) s chart, or will the bulls continue to run wild?

Chart technicians warn of bearish pattern on Apple (AAPL) stock chart

According to MarketWatch, the Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock chart displayed some disturbing intra-day trends on Wednesday despite closing at a record high for the third day in a row. Chart technicians saw what s called a  candlestick  chart forming a traditional bearish  doji  pattern. They believe the pattern suggests that there will be a short-term downtrend in the very near future.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock rallied during regular trading hours on Tuesday before opening at $135.52 on Wednesday. Wednesday was a choppy session during which the iPhone maker s shares bounced up and down throughout the day before closing the session nearly where it opened and around the midpoint of the intraday range.

This presents a classic  doji  pattern according to the Japanese candlestick charts, which have been around for more than two centuries. The word  doji  means  at the same time,  and when a doji follows a massive tear in a stock price, it s considered a sign of indecisiveness on the part of investors. It s also a warning of an impending trend reversal because it implies  indecision at a time that bulls should be most decisive,  explains MarketWatch.

Apple stock is overbought

Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock has also entered overbought territory, at least according to the Relative Strength Index. That index compares the magnitude of price gains and losses, and when it rises over 70, it suggests a stock is overbought. In Apple s case, the index neared 90 on Wednesday, the closest it has been to the 91.50 it reached in November 2004.

Investors have another reason to be concerned about the  doji  pattern, as a similar reversal happened in January 2006. Apple stock plunged following a long uptrend and big daily gain. The shares edged higher for the next couple trading sessions right after the 2006 doji, but they dropped off a cliff soon after and plunged by up to 40% until they hit bottom six months later. At that time, the Relative Strength Index was also in overbought territory just as it is now, adds MarketWatch.

Warren Buffett buys AAPL stock

Analysts have been whipping investors into a frenzy, assuring them that this will be the year the company takes them on a rocket ride to the moon with an iPhone 8 or iPhone X that does everything but make toast. Then this week, a regulatory filing revealed that Warren Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway gobbled up more shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock during the fourth quarter, quadrupling its holdings in the company. But it was after that news broke that the shares entered a period of choppiness.

Buffett is known for his acute ability to see value and recognize when a stock is undervalued, but he has traditionally avoided most tech stocks. It s speculated that his portfolio managers were mainly responsible for the purchase of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, although anything the size of this stake probably required his approval. After the year-to-date run, Buffett s firm may not buy any more shares any time soon  unless, of course, the doji chart pattern is right and a major downtrend is about to begin.

Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock edged higher by as much as 0.16% to $135.55 during regular trading hours on Friday. Apple Inc. (AAPL) May Have Different View On Trump's iPhone Manufacturing Plans Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) does not mind making Trump furious.

The U.S. President has been targeting Apple s low-energy and economically-sensible overseas manufacturing since the beginning. Even though the iPhone maker has so far stayed away from this debate, recent comments from CFO Luca Maestri suggest that the U.S. firm has no plans of closing up shop in China any time soon, according to BGR.

In response to a question about overseas manufacturing at a Goldman Sachs conference, Maestri said,  One of the points that we are making in Washington is the fact that we have been a very large contributor to the US economy during the last decade. We made billions of investments in the United States. In the last 10 years, we created about 2 million jobs in this country   in the developer community in our retail stores in our call centers and through the supplier chain. 

Maestri then talked about Apple s U.S.-located call centers, adding that speculating on Apple s manufacturing plans is really difficult, especially when Trump hasn t outlined any specific policies.

He did note that imposition of a border tax on imported products would lead to an additional burden on the end consumer.

This could also mean that Apple is making yet another attempt to take iPhone manufacturing off the table for discussions with Trump. It seems that the iPhone maker does not mind taking back ancillary services, such as support centers, back to the US, but it doesn t want to move the entire iPhone supply chain, notes BGR.

Apple s iPhone manufacturing has been in the news for quite some time now.

Reportedly, Apple asked its subsidiaries to examine the feasibility of iPhone manufacturing soon after Trump s electoral victory. This led Breitbart to run an (untrue) story: Silicon Valley Bows to Trump: Apple to Build iPhones in America.

Apple Back on Top in Smartphone Wars

Meanwhile, for the first time in the last eight quarters, Apple has taken the lead over Samsung Electronics ( SSNLF ) to become the world s top smartphone vendor. According to Gartner, during the crucial holiday season, the U.S. firm shipped the most smartphones, but it only enjoys a razor thin lead over the Korean firm.

As per Gartner s estimate, the U.S. firm shipped about 77.04 million smartphones in the fourth-quarter, just ahead of Samsungs s 76.78 million. Based on this, Apple s share in the global smartphone market is 17.9%, while that of Samsung is 17.8%. This is the smallest difference recorded by Gartner, according to CNBC.

Weak Demand May Impact Apple Stock Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has launched enough new iPhone models to be using the "iPhone 7" label for its latest. Each new model is supposedly packed with new features and comprise an "upgrade" that many iPhone users see as mandatory. One area where the iPhone has lagged is battery life. For many users (like me) that is a key feature. I am not alone. In a 2014 survey done in the U.K. almost 90% of users pointed to long battery life as a key consideration in buying a smartphone.

Source: Richard Hartley.com

Here is a recent comparison of iPhone 7 battery life to its key competitors.

Source: BGR.com

With all the geniuses at Cupertino, it is hard to imagine how Apple could be so far behind in battery performance unless you open your mind to the possibility that it is not happenstance. Does Apple purposely ensure its battery performance is sub-par? Is it a ploy to announce a major "upgrade" that does little more than catch up to the flagship devices sold by Apple competitors? I don't know, but it seems odd that such an important feature is so sub-par.

Batteries have become a key competitive battleground since the ill-fated Samsung Note 7 was released and immediately captured headlines for a spate of battery fires and explosions. Similar problems with iPhones got little public attention, a testimony to the strength of the Apple brand and the spin masters of Apple marketing.

While Apple has lost some market share, iPhone sales remain at high levels and even the strongest critics seem to think any decline in sales will be relatively minor, pointing to relatively minor cutbacks in production of iPhone components by a handful of suppliers as evidence of weaker than expected demand.

Of course, Apple fans always point to the "next big thing" - in this case, the iPhone 8 which is reportedly going to represent a major overhaul of the device - perhaps including an improved battery.

Forecasting iPhone sales has been a mugs game with even such heavyweights as Goldman Sachs unable to keep to a forecast for long. Wall Street in general keeps forecasting sustained growth for the iPhone while Goldman cut its forecast in mid-2016 by a substantial amount.

Source: Fortune

Pacific Crest calls for shipments of 225 million iPhones this year, not that far off the Goldman forecast.

KGI Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo calls for lower iPhone sales citing weakness in China and the likely absence of an upgrade to the iPhone SE.

Apple investors should pay attention to the signs of lagging iPhone sales if they materialize. At an average selling price of somewhere around $650, every 10 million iPhones contributes $6.5 billion in sales and very likely $4 billion contributed value to Apple. A fall of 30 to 40 million units would do serious damage both to Apple's income statement and to the credibility of the brand. No one (that I know of) foresees that dramatic a decline but I think it is in the range of possibilities.

The third quarter of 2016 demonstrated a continued decline in iPhone market share to less than 12%, a result I am sure Apple hopes will be reversed by demand for the new iPhone 7.

Source: Instant Flash News

Q4 2016 sales were disappointing for the full range of Apple products.

My forecast for fiscal 2017 is a bit more pessimistic than most. Based on a total smartphone market of 1.5 billion units and iPhone market share of 14%, I see iPhone sales of 200 million units. The tablet market is likely to be somewhere around 150 million units and iPad market share 25%, more or less.

The PC market should be in the range of 275 million units in 2017. Apple has a 7% market share, suggesting unit sales of 19 million.

Those data point to calendar 2017 sales of Apple products of $217 billion with earnings per share of just over $7.00. Those estimates exclude any tax penalty imposed by overseas authorities like Ireland and are based on a 26.5% tax rate and an assumed 37.5% margin.

It seems clear (at least to me) that the days of Apple growth are history and the company has become a very profitable, mature technology company with too much exposure to one product line. If we have a market downturn, which I see as long overdue, a price to earnings multiple of 15 times will be hard to justify, putting a value on Apple stock of $105-$110 per share. A more likely multiple of 12 times puts AAPL at $85 a share.

That puts me well in the camp of those who see AAPL as overvalued and a contrarian to those who see gains of up to 60% for AAPL stock in 2017.

I realize I am in the minority on this call, and certainly disagree with those who see 2017 as likely to be Apple's best year ever.

In any event, I would avoid the stock.

Why Intel Corporation's Modem Won't Find Success Outside of Apple Inc. In a recent note from Susquehanna Financial Group (via Barron's), analyst Christopher Rolland said that he and his team were "optimistic" that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) might be able to find business outside of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its stand-alone cellular modems but noted that "Chinese handset vendors did not share [Susquehanna's] enthusiasm."

Here's my take on why Intel just won't get any traction with its modems outside of Apple, no matter how good they are.

Understanding the market

A smartphone maker can opt to equip a smartphone with a stand-alone applications processor paired with a stand-alone cellular baseband processor, or it can choose to use a single chip that integrates the applications processor with the cellular baseband processor.

In the early innings of the smartphone market, it wasn't uncommon to see both -- some smartphone makers would go with stand-alone baseband and applications processors, while others would pick the more integrated solutions.

Today, for cost and space reasons, integrated solutions dominate the market. It's virtually impossible today to market stand-alone smartphone applications processors, and there's only one high volume smartphone customer that uses stand-alone cellular baseband chips -- Apple.

Intel doesn't sell integrated solutions

In the past, Intel had indicated that it aimed to both sell integrated applications processor/baseband solutions alongside stand-alone modems. However, the company has slashed its investments in mobile technology over the last couple of years (Intel says its investment in this area is down 55% over the last two years) and hasn't said much publicly about trying again to build such integrated parts organically.

The chipmaker is attacking this market in a roundabout fashion by offering manufacturing services to companies like Spreadtrum, but it remains to be seen whether Intel can gain significant traction in the mass-market smartphone market (outside of Apple) this way.

Intel could conceivably try to field organically developed integrated solutions into this market at some point, but given that Intel already tried, failed spectacularly, and pulled the plug on its efforts here, it's hard to imagine that smartphone vendors would be in a hurry to bet their businesses on Intel's product road map and execution.

But the bottom line is that there's simply just not a market outside of Apple for stand-alone cellular modems, even if those modems are highly competent.

The next step for Intel

In the near to medium term, Intel's job will be to focus on trying to continue to build competent stand-alone modems to keep Apple happy. Apple buys enough chips, and Intel probably gets enough for each chip, that Intel could probably continue to justify modem development just with Apple's business.

At some point, though, Intel is going to want to expand the total addressable market that it can address with its modem technology.

Maybe another crack at the integrated smartphone applications processor market would be the right course of action, or perhaps it could partner with a third-party chipmaker to incorporate its modem technology into their own applications processors (a suggestion that's been thrown around about Apple, although I doubt that it would be interested in doing that).

The point is that if Intel can consistently deliver great cellular modem technology, and if that technology has been "battle tested" inside of multiple generations of Apple iPhone models, then it would be a shame for the chipmaker to not find a way to get it into other smartphones and profit from it. All Eyes on Tesla Inc (TSLA) Model 3 Ramp and Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone  The Great  Though Cowen and Drexel Hamilton are divided on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), whether bearish or bullish, everything is riding on Tesla s Model 3 ramp and Apple s 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone. Though one analyst continues to project beneath buyside expectations, he believes investor sentiment will not be shaken should the Model 3 earn the key vote of confidence Tesla needs. Conversely, another analyst backs Apple all the way, even amid the unveiling of  cool  Samsung devices, as he finds this is Apple s smartphone market game to lose. Let s take a closer look:

Tesla s Key to Unlocking Investor Confidence: Model 3

Cowen analyst Jeff Osborne is out with a research report on Tesla ahead of what he projects to be a release of 23,000 deliveries at the start of the upcoming week. A lot of pressure is facing the electric car giant from the analyst s standpoint, as the way he sizes up Tesla, all shareholder  sentiment hinges on [the] Model 3 ramp. 

On back of an  asymmetric risk/reward profile,  the analyst reiterates an Underperform rating on shares of TSLA with a $155 price target, which represents a 7% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

Osborn notes,  Our estimate is at the low end of buyside expectations of 23,000-24,500, which we believe are not fully accounting for delays in EPA approval of the new 100 kWh battery-based vehicles until mid-March, as well as softer trends in Jan/Feb. 

 While deliveries may be softer than investor expectations, all eyes will likely be on Model 3 comments and order growth rates for the S/X. Recent quarters have shown 50-70% growth in S/X orders; however, deliveries haven t shown that pace. Commentary about 2H17 growth in core S/X sales is also in focus given saturation fears,  continues the analyst.

Overall,  While we expect some softness in 1Q17 deliveries, potentially by a 1k-1.5k units versus buyside expectations, we don t believe this will cause a stir with investors long the stock given the impending ramp of the Model 3,  concludes Osborne who places a great deal of pressure riding on the Model 3 ramp as the ultimate  key to investor confidence. 

As usual, we recommend taking analyst notes with a grain of salt. According to TipRanks, Jeff Osborne is ranked #4,452 out of 4,555 analysts. Osborne has a 39% success rate and faces a loss of 16.8% in his annual returns. When recommending TSLA, Osborne earns 0.0% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics demonstrate TSLA as a Hold. Out of 16 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 5 are bullish on Tesla stock, 5 remain sidelined, and 6 are bearish on the stock. With a loss potential of 11%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $246.67.

Apple iPhone Unbeatable, So No Samsung Apprehension Here

Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White remains adamantly bullish on Apple, even following Samsung s Galaxy UNPACKED 2017 event, where Apple s rival brought  two, cool new smartphones  to the table. However, the analyst believes Apple investors have no reason to start quaking in fear, as between Samsung s combustible Galaxy Note 7 and Apple s heavy iPhone 8 hype, in a battle of Samsung vs. Apple, Apple takes the clear victory.

Therefore, continuing to praise the tech giant as globally underestimated and with great enthusiasm for the upcoming fall launch of  iPhone  The Great,'  the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on AAPL with a price target of $185, which represents a 28% increase from where the shares last closed. Additionally, considering Apple is back on the revenue growth train as of the first fiscal quarter of this year, momentum seems to be rolling on the giant s side.

White opines,  Given a healthy uptake with the iPhone 7/7 Plus at Apple and the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco at Samsung, Apple made claim to the #1 position (i.e., unit market share from IDC) in the smartphone market during 4Q:16 for the first time since 4Q:11. Moreover, the arrest of Samsung s heir apparent/de facto leader (Lee Jae-yong; Vice Chairman) for bribery charges and the pre-trial hearing has provided further distractions at the company.  Should Samsung trip once more, its competitive edge in the smartphone market might irrevocably be dented, which would further propel Apple s standing in the tech stratosphere.

 Given the reported cases of the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 catching fire and exploding, we believe consumers will be more apprehensive about buying a new Samsung device this time around. Moreover, this year is the tenth anniversary for the iPhone and the excitement around the upcoming iPhone is greater relative to years past, thus we believe potential buyers of the S8/ S8 Plus may wait for the new iPhone to be unveiled. That said, Samsung s flagship  S  phones have proven to be solid devices over the years,  White contends.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, five-star analyst Brian White is ranked #152 out of 4,555 analysts. White has a 64% success rate and garners 10.3% in his yearly returns. When recommending AAPL, White gains 24.0% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics show AAPL as a Buy. Based on 37 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 29 rate a Buy on Apple stock, 6 maintain a Hold, while 2 issue a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $153.07, marking a 6% upside from where the stock is currently trading. Donald Trump Now An iPhone User After Calling For Apple Inc. (AAPL) Boycott Donald Trump is apparently learning more and more every day that being President is much more difficult than just blurting out whatever comes to mind.

Source: Sunnyc

Sure, you can call for a boycott of Apple Inc. s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhones before you re elected, but after you re in the White House, the government decides what kind of smartphone you re going to use  even if it happens to be an iPhone.

So while you might think you ll be able to do anything you want when you become president, that s not actually the case. He seems to be learning the hard way why it s best to keep your mouth shut until you find out what you ll actually be able to do so that people don t call you out for doing the opposite of what you said you would do, like use an iPhone when you said no one should use an iPhone.

White House Social Media Director Dan Scavino, Jr. revealed on Twitter that Trump is using an iPhone now.

.@POTUS @realDonaldTrump has been using his new iPhone?for the past couple of weeks here on Twitter. Yes, it is #POTUS45 reading & tweeting!   Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) March 29, 2017

Although Scavino clearly states that the President has been using an iPhone for the  past couple of weeks,  CNN Money notes that a  tweet bearing the hallmarks of Trump s combative style was sent from an Android device as recently as Saturday. 

Mobil Phones a Matter of National Security

The issue of him using an unsecured phone prompted some Democrats to send an official letter to Defense Secretary James Mattis in February requesting details about the kinds of mobile devices the President is using.

As President of the United States, Donald Trump has access to some very sensitive information, so U.S. intelligence agencies must ensure that he has the most secure smartphone possible. He has been criticized for using an older, unsecured Android phone even after his inauguration, despite the report that he had ditched the phone.

Now instead of using an Android phone to tweet, he s supposedly been using the government-issued iPhone. It s unclear whether it s a custom model designed specifically for the President or just a standard model. Officials will not say whether any security measures are in place on Trump s mobile devices.

When Barack Obama was in office, he used various devices, including a specialized BlackBerry long after most people were using an iPhone, and later, a stripped-down phone with pure security in mind and few features.

Trump Called for iPhone Boycott

The tech community has always paid close attention to what kind of smartphone the world s leaders are using, and in Trump s case, the use of an iPhone has been met with a healthy heap of derision. While on the campaign trail, he called for a boycott of Apple s devices until the company complied with the government s demand to help unlock the iPhone 5c used by one of the San Bernardino shooters.

Interestingly, that very issue could be one reason the government has decided that the iPhone is secure enough for the President. Apple refused to unlock the phone used by a deceased man officials say is a terrorist, and government hackers were having a difficult time unlocking it, at least until they bought an exploit from a third party.

Even before being elected, he didn t seem to be locked into his call for a boycott because tweets were posted from both iPhones and Android phones. Some, however, have suggested that his aides were using Apple devices to post tweets while Trump himself used an Android phone.

More From InvestorPlace Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Is Still a Value Play Gotham Asset Management co-founder Joel Greenblatt certainly thinks Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) provides good value for buyers of AAPL stock.

Source: Shutterstock

In a recent interview, Greenblatt talked about how expensive the markets are at the present moment:

 When we think about the S&P 500, we go back over the last 26 years where we have good data and look at the entire market from a perspective of bottom s up valuation. Right now the S&P 500 is in roughly the 17th percentile of expensive during those 26 years, meaning it s been cheaper 83% of the time. 

To beat the index Greenblatt buys the cheapest S&P 500 stocks and shorts the most expensive. And wouldn t you know it, but AAPL stock is one of his largest holdings   31st out of 925 positions in a $7.8 billion portfolio   at 337,952 shares as of December 31, 2016.

For Greenblatt, it s all about cash flow and the price you pay for it:

 We ve owned Apple for a long time   They generate lots of cash flow, and we don t have to pay a big price for it. That s what s attracted recent investors like Warren Buffett, where he s looking at both that mix between growth and value   We figure out what a business is worth and try to pay a lot less. 

Is AAPL Stock a Value Stock?

He believes the markets are still valuing AAPL stock as a hardware company when in fact it s very much a service business with iTunes, App Store, Apple Music, etc. CNBC Mad Money host Jim Cramer also feels Apple s service business is underappreciated by investors, thoughts I shared with readers in early February when Apple was trading around $129; up almost 10% since then.

InvestorPlace contributor Chris Lau recently discussed how Apple stock hasn t come close to peaking. I couldn t agree more, which is why I asked the rhetorical question back in February of how AAPL stock got to $200.

Apple s service revenue accounted for about 9% of overall sales in Q1 2017, growing 18% year-over-year to $7.2 billion. Annualize that and we re talking about almost $29 billion. That s huge when you consider Piper Jeffrey analyst Gene Munster estimated in 2016 that Apple s gross margins on its service revenues were 60% and that operating margins could hit 50% in the coming year.

If that s accurate, Apple s operating profits in fiscal 2017 could be as high as $15 billion or $2.86 per share for this small part of its business.

Next Page Apple To $250? - A Dividend Perspective With very moderate growth assumptions, we see the possibility of $250 per share.

Many people feel that Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is undervalued. While there are many ways to evaluate a stock, this post will look at Apple from a dividend perspective.

Dividend issues

Typically, dividend investors are long-term investors, less interested in share price growth than in the dividends and the growth of dividends over time.

Therefore, the questions for them are:

How safe is the investment over the long term? What is the current dividend yield? Does the company currently have room to grow dividends (Payout ratio)? Will the company grow earnings?

All these lead to the ultimate question:

What is the likely long-term yield?

Comparisons

To begin with, I made a list with recent dividend-related data from Apple and several other companies. The first four (after Apple itself) are related or frequently compared to Apple. The last two are commonly considered among the top choices for dividend investors. They rate well in yield and are considered very stable, with long histories of dividend increases.

Dividend issues

1- The future

Regarding the first question, no one really questions if Apple will be around for a long time to come. True, one would have said the same thing for BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) just a few years ago, but that demise was a self-inflicted wound, and even that took several years to unfold.

Apple is a stable, income-producing machine. In spite of last year's moderate retraction in sales and revenues, it looks likely to continue modest growth. I wrote earlier about four likely scenarios for Apple's future. Given the company's return to moderate growth, it seems likely that this will continue.

2- Current dividend yield

As we can see from the chart, of the companies that offer a dividend, Apple has by far the lowest yield. This is not something that recommends it to the dividend investor. On the other hand, in another post, I noted how the share repurchase program could be viewed as equivalent to dividends that have been reinvested in stock purchase. Using this analysis, we arrived at a yield of 6.45% for the calendar-year 2016.

We will return to this shortly.

3- Payout ratio

The current payout ratio of Apple (26.6%) is also very low, which is a good sign. This is only true, however, if you ignore the repurchases. Repurchase and dividends combined represented 106% of 2016 earnings; a figure that Apple is unlikely to continue. Not counting the repurchase program, however, there is plenty of room to grow, even if earnings growth were to come to a halt.

4- Will earnings grow

This is a hotly debated topic, with many feeling that Apple has peaked in sales of the iPhone, which represents the largest share of income. Yet, even here unit sales have hit a record in the last quarter, and the ASP has remained high.

While iPad unit sales continue to fall, the rate is slowing, and perhaps, we will soon meet a floor value. Macs have returned to revenue growth last quarter, although the unit sales dropped slightly.

One of the big news items was strong growth in Apple's Services sector (18% year over year). This is something I expect to continue for some time at or near this growth level.

When we look at all together, we do see continued modest growth, even if there are no significant new products offered. If some revolutionary new product does come up, then that would provide even further growth.

How to evaluate

I will provide a reasonably conservative view of the future for Apple, making the following assumptions.

iPhone will continue to grow, taking on new users and switchers. Over the long haul, the growth rate will be modest, but positive. Services will continue to grow. Macs will grow very modestly. iPads will stagnate, but no longer drop. The Other category will grow modestly.

Put this all together and Apple will have a long-term average growth of 5% annually.

There are great expectations for the next iPhone release. Analysts expect there to be a "super-cycle" due to many updates, particularly the overall appearance. (There are many pundits who cannot see any innovation that does not impact the physical appearance of the product. See my post The Lost Innovation Meme.) In any case, there is likely to be a large boost in sales similar to what took place two years ago when the first Plus model was released. It is also likely that this will be followed with flat, or a moderate drop off in sales the following year. For this reason, I am predicting only a 5% average growth rate.

The dividend investor is not that interested in the pig-through-the-python income phenomenon. They are interested in the long-term trend. So I have projected an average EPS growth of 5% for the next four years, driven by both performance and continued share repurchase.

Caveat:

We make assumptions above because we must make some assumptions if we are to proceed with the analysis. I have given a relatively conservative set of assumptions. I have made no allowance for any major new products or an acquisition that would raise revenue. You most likely have a different set of figures, more generous or more conservative. These are not meant to be hard predictions, particularly in the short run. They represent just one working example of how things might play out.

Dividend increases

We have noted that dividend investors like increases, and that Apple has plenty of both cash and earnings to greatly increase the dividends. While last quarter's total payouts (repurchases and dividends) exceeded earnings, this was an unusual case, most likely driven by the share price low of $90.

Even so, the repurchase was by far the larger portion. Over the last calendar year, repurchase was almost three times that of dividends - $35.70 to $12.30 (in billions). Thus, Apple can easily reduce the overall payout, move a large percentage from repurchases to dividends, and still have billions in the share buyback program.

In an earlier article, I noted how Apple could repatriate cash to cover extended dividends without needing to incur further debt.

Finally, Tim Cook has repeatedly said that buybacks make sense while the stock is undervalued. It only makes sense that the buybacks would decrease as the share price approaches what Apple believes it should be.

So this gives us an opportunity to make some further assumptions.

Apple wants to have a total annual payout of 80% earnings, and As the share price rises, dividends will represent 80% of the total program.

The two together give us that dividends will rise to become 64% of earnings (or of EPS on a share basis).

Our assumed 5% average growth gives us the second column in the following chart, the 64% figure gives us the third. In reality, the move to 64% would not happen right away, but would reach that point in perhaps 2019.

Implied share price

The annual dividends listed each imply a share price. The range is pretty much set for high quality dividend stocks, the dividend yield ranges more or less between 2.2% and 3%. Let us say that the dividend market wants to value Apple the same as Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), at 2.44% yield.

Then, if in 2019, the dividend reaches $6.19, we would have:

0.0244 x Price = $6.19

or

Price = $6.19/0.0244 = $255.69

Risks

The risks are there, of course. Tech companies fail to keep up with the competition and lose favor with the public. Competition from low cost Chinese manufacturers could take increasing market share from Apple's premium products.

Clearly, Apple has proven over the last few years that it can ride the above two factors. They remain the most valued brand and ASPs have stabilized or even risen. It has a huge moat of ever increasing attachment to the ecosystem the longer the customer is engaged. It has, as well, the highest satisfaction ratings in the business. These things do not change overnight. Yet, these risk factors do remain as possibilities.

Perhaps, the greatest real risk to Apple would be getting caught in the crossfire of an international trade war. This is a serious concern given its huge dependence on its Chinese manufacturing chain.

Summary

The market is funny. They say that it is "smart" and will eventually find the right price for a stock. But in some respects it is not. It has never really valued the fact that Apple has a tremendous cash hoard. It has ignored that completely. Now it seems to be ignoring the value of the repurchase plan as well. The market will accept only the actual dividends in computing the yield, and thus comes up short of its real value.

The argument above shows that if we make a few very reasonable assumptions, then by 2019, Apple could be easily worth over $250.

The fact is, if you count repurchases as a special kind of dividend, then, by a fair dividend yield evaluation, it should already be there now.

Your comments are appreciated.

Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Thursday's Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), General Motors Company (GM) and ... U.S. stock futures are headed lower this morning, as the major market indexes are set to retreat ahead of a trio of speeches from the Federal Reserve and an update on fourth-quarter gross domestic product. What s more, Wall Street is still trying to find its feet after last week s GOP health care failure raised doubts about the strength of President Trump s agenda.

Heading into the open, futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average are down 0.03%, while S&P 500 futures have shed 0.05%, as are Nasdaq-100 futures.

On the options front, volume continued to trickle lower on Wednesday, as only about 13.1 million calls and 10.6 million puts changed hands on the session. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio dropped to a one-month low of 0.54, driving the 10-day moving average lower to 0.64.

Driving Wednesday s options volume, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) rallied to new all-time highs after analysts at UBS said AAPL stock could go as high as $200 in two to three years. Elsewhere, General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) continued to push back against David Einhorn s Greenlight Capital and its plans to split GM stock into two investor classes. Finally, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NYSE: CHK ) surged more than 7% following a spike in oil prices and President Donald Trump s energy policy order.

Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Another day, another all-time high, another bullish analyst note for Apple. Yesterday, UBS AG analyst Steven Milunovich said that he believed that AAPL stock could rise as high as $200 in the next two to three years. That said, Milunovich reiterated his  buy  rating and $151 price target for AAPL, and said that $175 was a more likely target for the shares.

AAPL stock has hit back-to-back all-time highs in the past two sessions, helping to drive heavy call volume on the shares. In fact, more than 1.3 million contracts traded on Apple Wednesday, keeping the total north of the one-million mark all week. Calls made up a well-above-average 69% of the day s take.

However, this recent attention to AAPL calls appears to be mostly short-term profit taking. Specifically, the April put/call open interest ratio ticked higher once again, coming in at 0.96 after hitting 0.95 yesterday and 0.90 on Monday. Once again, this could be a warning sign of weakness for Apple over the next month.

Next Page Apple Car Rumors: Apple Inc. Hires Robotics Experts, Bosch New Parts Supplier No one knows for sure when or whether Apple would release its highly-anticipated car code-named Project Titan. But leaks and rumors have repeatedly shown that the company is making progress on the Apple car. A new report coming out of Switzerland claims the Cupertino company has hired  at least  ten post-doctoral students from the ETH Zurich.

Visual navigation, robotics experts in demand

According to Inside IT (via Apple Insider), the new hires would be operating out of Apple s research facility in Switzerland, where it is reportedly working on the Apple car project. The Swiss publication added that most of the recruits specialized in visual navigation, robotics, and computer vision. Roland Siegwart, a professor of autonomous systems at ETH Zurich, told Inside IT that many of his students had left the institute to join multinational corporations, without naming Apple.

However, Professor Roland Siegwart was unaware of Apple s R&D center in the country. Most of the times Apple officially announces the opening of an international R&D facility. But the company maintains secrecy when the research center is related to new product categories, says Apple Insider. In April last year, a German magazine revealed that Apple had set up a secret lab in Berlin to design and develop a self-driving car.

Bosch s Reutlingen facility makes only auto parts

Meanwhile, Apple has released its 2017 Supplier Responsibility report. The report includes a total of 705 suppliers, up from 640 in 2015. The responsibility report highlights how its suppliers have worked towards improving energy efficiency, land diversion, and responsible sourcing of materials. Buried in the list of more than 700 suppliers is a Bosch manufacturing facility that makes only automobile-related parts.

It has sparked speculations that the iPhone maker might be actively sourcing components for the Apple car. The facility in question is owned by Robert Bosch GmbH, and is located at  Tuebinger Strasse 123 facility in Reutlingen, Germany.  Bosch makes a wide range of products, including the barometric sensor that Apple used in the iPhone 6S. However, Bosch employees told Apple Insider on condition of anonymity that the facility mentioned in Apple s supplier report exclusively makes automotive and  mobility enhancement  products like gait trainers and wheelchairs.

The Reutlingen facility s functional areas also include research and development. The Cupertino company is reportedly working on the Project Titan under a shell company named SixtyEight Research. Apple has purchased multiple real estate properties in and around Sunnyvale in California since last year, many of which have been linked to the Apple car project.

Where does the project stand at this point?

It is unclear how much progress Apple has made on its car project. Until early last year, rumors suggested that the company was developing a full-fledged car that would be ready for launch sometime around 2020. Apple had assembled an ambitious team of more than 1,000 engineers. But things didn t proceed as expected, and Apple had to lay off hundreds of employees. Even project head Steve Zadesky left the company last year.

Since then, Apple has narrowed its focus, with Bob Mansfield leading the project. Instead of building the whole car, Mansfield and his team are now focused on developing the autonomous driving software and supporting hardware. They have been given until the end of 2017 to prove the viability of the project. Apple is reportedly testing the prototypes in a virtual reality environment to keep them away from competitors and the media.

Apple has acknowledged the existence of Project Titan

If Apple succeeds in developing the autonomous driving system, it can either partner with an existing automaker or design its own car. The Apple car is expected to be tightly integrated with the iOS devices. In a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) late last year, Apple publicly acknowledged that it was working on a car project.

Steve Kenner, Apple s director of product integrity, said in a letter to the US regulators that the company was investing huge amounts of money in an automobile project. Kenner urged the NHTSA not to impose too many restrictions on self-driving vehicles as Apple was about the start testing the technology. The company was studying  machine learning and automation,  and it was  excited  about the potential of automation in transportation.

Kenner said in his letter that Apple was keen to work with the NHTSA to  help define the best practices for the industry.  The Apple executive demanded that new entrants such as Apple and established players like GM and Ford should be treated equally. Apple also proposed the idea of sharing  crashes and near-misses  data among automakers to enhance the technology and reduce the rate of accidents.

Will Apple car be too late to the market?

The iPhone maker has also registered multiple domain names such as Apple.car and Apple.auto. Though Apple owns thousands of domain names, the automobile-related names indicate that the company is at least interested in the industry.

As if these reports were not enough to prove the existence of the Apple car project, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called it an  open secret  last year. Musk also believes that the Apple car is a  missed opportunity.  There will be many autonomous electric cars on the road by the time Apple car arrives. At one point, there were speculations that Apple was planning to buy Tesla. The Apple car is said to compete directly against Tesla s premium Model S and Model X vehicles.

Didi investment gave Apple access to traffic data

Last year, Apple surprised everyone by investing $1 billion in the Chinese ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing. Experts argue that Apple needs tons of traffic data to develop the autonomous driving system. The Didi investment would give the company access to traffic and driver behavior data in the world s most populous country. When announcing the investment, Apple CEO Tim Cook said the decision was driven by  a number of strategic reasons. 

The Didi investment sparked speculations that Apple and Didi could partner on a self-driving car in the near future. Earlier this month, Didi announced it had set up a research lab in the backyard of Apple in California. The facility would focus on AI-based security for transportation and  intelligent-driving systems.  It is unclear whether Didi s research lab is linked to the Apple car project. The Chinese company may have its own ambitions in the self-driving space, considering the technology could revolutionize the ride-hailing industry.

Consumers excited about the Apple car

The Cupertino company s investment in Didi was an unusual move. Usually, Apple makes only low-profile acquisitions. Only time will tell how Apple is going to utilize the massive investment. But one thing is certain   Apple fans are more excited about the Apple car than any other product, even though it is years away or worse, may never hit the roads.

Last month, Baird analyst William Power conducted a survey to gauge consumer interest in the future Apple products. He asked 3,000 American consumers which product or service they would want from Apple in the

Warren Buffett Has Boosted His Apple, Inc. Position Nearly Tenfold in 4 Months Just a couple weeks ago, 13F filings started flowing in, and Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) ownership disclosures showed that Warren Buffett nearly quadrupled his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) position in the fourth quarter. The Oracle of Omaha closed out 2016 with approximately 57.4 million shares, up from the 15.2 million shares Berkshire Hathaway was holding at the end of the third quarter.

Well, it turns out that Buffett wasn't done loading up on Apple. Not by a long shot.

Berkshire Hathaway is now the single largest holder of Apple

In an interview with CNBC this morning, Buffett shared some more about what Berkshire Hathaway has been buying in the early innings of 2017. Spoiler alert: even more Apple. Since the close of the fourth quarter that's covered by the 13F, Buffett said that Berkshire continued to buy shares up until earnings; Berkshire stopped buying shares after earnings when shares jumped. Berkshire more than doubled its Apple position during the month of January, and its total holdings are now approximately 133 million shares, valued at around $17 billion.

While doubling an already large position over the course of a month is already a pretty bullish signal to investors, it's even more bullish when you compound that over a longer period of time. As mentioned above, Berkshire finished the third quarter with 15.2 million shares, so a position of 133 million shares represents a nearly tenfold increase in just 4 months.

Furthermore, shares are already up about 13% for February, so Berkshire's Apple position continues to perform well, as shares now trade at all-time highs.

As famously averse to tech as Buffett is, it's just as well known that he loves consistent cash flow. The Oracle notes that the iPhone is incredibly sticky, and so many people have integrated the device into their daily lives that it's become indispensable. Apple customers are also incredibly loyal, so they stick with the brand at a higher rate relative to other consumer electronics companies. That all feeds back into cash flow, since Apple is able to generate recurring hardware revenue with ongoing product cycles.

At this point, Berkshire is the single largest holder of Apple, with about a 2.5% stake in the company. The only companies that hold more shares are fund companies like Vanguard and Fidelity, among others, who aggregate their holdings across all funds for reporting purposes. That includes passive funds and ETFs that only hold Apple in order to track an underlying index, although there are certainly some active funds in the mix as well. For example, the single largest mutual fund holder of Apple is the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, a passive index fund that had 109.5 million shares at the end of January (Apple is its largest holding).

It's mildly ironic that an investor that's not into tech is now the largest owner of the largest tech company. The Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Car Will Change Automotive History

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is positioning itself to enter into one of the world's largest and most competitive industries. The road to success is fraught with hazards and the potential reward is huge. Apple has built one of the strongest brands in history, turning electronic devices into status symbols through their brilliant marketing, design aesthetic, and reputation for dependability.Now they will put their brand and technology prowess to the test as they plunge into the market of the world's most recognized status symbol: The Luxury Automobile.Their brand and a substantial portion of their $750 billion market cap hangs in the balance.We start by capturing what is publicly known or widely believed about the Apple Car project, code-named "Titan":The automotive industry is one of the world's largest markets, with luxury cars alone accounting for $360 billion per year in sales and growing fast:The electric vehicle market weighed in at over $80 billion in 2012 and is projected to hit greater than $270 billion by 2019:The world's largest vehicle producer is, surprisingly to American car owners, Volkswagen, with global sales of over 200 billion euros per year, followed closely by Toyota (source: Statista). Put in perspective, Volkswagen has roughly the same total revenue as Apple's $240 billion USD. A successful launch for Apple could realistically double revenues, and with time, operating margins and substantial new profits would be sure to follow.The risk to Apple's brand if the car launch is unsuccessful is enormous. In 2010 an antenna problem with the iPhone 4 was a recoverable embarrassment. In the automotive realm, any mishap could have dire consequences. When Tesla was a little known startup with grand ideas, they were able to survive several batteries catching fire. Serious, potentially dangerous problems with the Apple Car would likely have far broader implications with down-stream effects across the Apple ecosystem.The most obvious competition comes from Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), which is a company that created an unbelievably strong brand. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will have to grapple with the reality that in the automotive space, there is a brand that is tied to technology that is going to be a burden to overcome, even for the mighty mac maker.The competition also sprawls into the makers of the brain of a self-driving car -- and that means Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Waymo.For the longest time this project felt like one of the many moonshots that would never really see the light of day - that's what Wall Street would have had us think, at least. But it isn't a moonshot, it's a business - and a rather large one.No company is better positioned to make a huge technological investment, backed by a brilliant marketing campaign, and championed by a beloved brand, than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). If Apple succeeds in releasing its car, they are likely to not only reap enormous financial rewards, but also to massively swell the size of the electric vehicle market and, in so doing, create a permanent shift to a new era of automotive history.And, now we know -- people want an Apple Car -- and they want it more than anything else the company can deliver.The author is long shares of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the time of this writing. Is Apple The Best Dividend Growth Stock In The Market? Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest company in the world in terms of market cap and therefore demands regular attention for investors; both institutional and retail, alike. Apple is far and away the most commonly subscribed to and followed individual stock here on Seeking Alpha - and rightfully so. Apple is a unique stock in regard to the way that portfolio managers can justify holding shares in just about any sort of strategic portfolio. When looking at funds, both actively and passively managed, whether you're looking for value or growth, whether you're seeking alpha or trying to preserve capital, or whether you're looking for tech-specific or market-wide exposure, you'll likely find Apple shares included. What's more, there's a group of investors that are becoming increasingly interested in owning Apple shares: income-oriented investors.

I follow the dividend growth scene closely, and I've noticed a significant uptick of Apple interest over the last couple of years. I've seen more and more DGI managers justifying Apple shares for their portfolios, and I think Tim Cook and Co. have done what it takes with regard to shareholder returns to earn the respect of income-oriented investors. Over the last couple of years, I've read a myriad of articles here and elsewhere asking the question, "is AAPL a dividend growth stock?" Well, in this piece, I'd like to go one step further, focusing on the company's shareholder returns a while asking, is AAPL the best dividend growth stock for investors today?

Since Apple initiated its dividend in 2012, I began interested in the stock. Once the company made its commitment to grow the dividend clear, I began accumulating my current position. The company has maintained its spot at the very top of my portfolio ever since, shuffling back and forth with Disney (NYSE:DIS) between the number 1 and number 2 spots in terms of overall weighting. Apple is a company that I feel at ease owning. I know some believe that this company is a one-trick pony; I'll cover this later in the piece, but for the time being, all I can say is that I sleep well at night knowing that Apple is a core position for me on my journey towards financial freedom. And just to be clear, it is no easy thing for me to say that Apple is potentially a better DGI investment than Disney.

DYI DGI Investors Are Coming Around To Apple

Before I get into my own analysis of Apple and why I believe it is quite possibly the world's best dividend growth investment opportunity, I want to take a look at how it stacks up against the other popular DGI holdings in today's DGI blogosphere. I don't know if you caught it or not, but my fellow Seeking Alpha contributor FerdiS published an absolutely wonderful piece covering the gambit DGI portfolios published on the internet by their owners back at the start of the year. This piece was awarded an Editor's Pick by SA, and deservedly so. I implore you to read this piece as soon as you're done with this one (heck, feel free to take a break and switch over now if you prefer); FerdiS did a lot of data collection for his article, and the result was a series of very interesting observations of today's DYI DGI investor.

When looking at FerdiS' work, Apple is the 16th most commonly-owned stock out of the 236 unique tickers owned across the DGI blogosphere - appearing in 11 out of the 32 portfolios tracked. Apple was the most commonly held tech company, one spot ahead of Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) which appeared in 10 portfolios, IBM (NYSE:IBM) which appeared in 9, and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which rounded out the commonly-owned tech coverage; both appearing in 7.

While Apple didn't receive a high ranking in the overall ownership ranks, it did nearly crack the top 5 dividend growth holdings amongst the group of portfolios tracked in terms of weighting. The company was 6th on the weighting list with a 0.69% average weighting. FerdiS is a better man than me because I'm not willing to do the leg work to go over each of the 32 DGI portfolios tracked, but I assume this is because one (or several) of the larger portfolios in the group have Apple as a top 5 holding. Looking at FerdiS' work, the average weighting on a top position was 7.9%. The top overall weighting within one of the portfolios tracked was 16.2%, so this skews that number a bit higher, though overall, it's clear that DGI investors are happy to go very overweight in their largest positions.

FerdiS also put together a similar piece which can be viewed here regarding equity ownership within dividend growth ETFs. It's interesting to note that while retail investors seem to be coming around to Apple within the DGI community, dividend growth managers aren't quite there yet, with Apple coming in 23rd place overall with only 6 of 27 of the ETFs that he included in his study owning shares of the company. IBM held the top tech spot with regard to frequency of ownership within the tech sector, followed by Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Cisco, Intel, and then Apple, in the 5th spot overall (remember, Apple was the top tech holding within the retail DGI group).

Like in the retail group, Apple did climb in the rankings when looking at average weighting, though it's still 18th overall, behind IBM, Microsoft, Qualcomm, and Cisco when looking at tech sector peers. I thought the divergence between the retail and institutional sentiments regarding Apple as a DGI investment was interesting; as a retail guy writing about how Apple is his top DGI pick, I'm happy to see that while others may not be as bullish as I am, I'm not alone in this boat, and it'll be interesting to see a few years down the road how these exposures evolve, and if the retail investor was ahead of the game with regard to Apple.

Apple Has Cash For Days

So, why am I so bullish? Namely, the size and scale of Apple's cash flows and the generosity that management has shown with this cash over the last 5 years or so. Apple's free cash flow has increased from $6.50/share in 2012 to $9.50 over the trailing 12 months. In 2015, free cash flow/share hit an all-time high for this company at $11.83, but suffered a bit in 2016, coming in at $8.97. Investors and analysts alike seem to believe that Apple will return to growth in 2017/2018 as pent-up demand for the iPhone 8 makes itself more and more apparent. Regardless of the level of this growth, the company's current free cash flow yield is an impressive 7%, something that I can easily live with moving forward.

These massive cash flows have enabled Apple to amass a record fortune, which swelled to nearly $250b at the end of the most recent quarter. Much of this cash is locked up overseas, which has been a problem for this company for years now, not wanting to give an outsized chunk of it to Uncle Sam upon bringing it back home. Well, repatriation appears to be a part of the Trump administration's tax plan, and while it's not clear what the potential tax rate might be in a one-time holiday, it's likely to be a major boon for Apple and its shareholders either way. If Apple is able to bring home the lion's share of its overseas reserves, it will give this company a lot of flexibility to potentially grow the business, pay down debt, and reward shareholders.

The Dividend: A Double-Digit Growth Machine

Apple initiated a $0.38 quarterly dividend payment in the 3rd quarter of 2012. Today, after consistently giving investors an annual increase since, its quarterly payment sits at $0.57/share. This growth over a 4-year period represents a 10.67 CAGR on the dividend; I suspect that Apple will continue to reward investors with high-single digit/low-double digit returns over the short-medium term. Apple typically makes a raise on its May payment, so I'm looking forward to the news of an increase in the coming months. Apple has a very low payout ratio of ~25%, which means that it should have no issues continuing on its current double-digit dividend growth pace.

The Buyback: Successfully Reducing Outstanding Shares and Saving The Company Cash

Making matters better for investors, Apple's dividend growth generosity has been dwarfed by its willingness to return cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks. Apple has become famous for announcing buyback programs bigger than the market caps of many S&P 500 companies. Although some investors frown upon this practice as an unimaginative use of cash that reeks of failing innovation and a corporate environment that lacks the creativity that was so apparent under Jobs, I don't blame current CEO Tim Cook for dedicating massive amounts of funds to buybacks. Apple is a cash flow machine and these shares are being bought back at bargain barrel multiples. This has been the case now for several years. And, now that Apple shares have gone on a run and sit at multi-year highs as analysts begin to fact in service growth into their revenue forecasts and call for an iPhone 8 "super cycle," it appears that these past moves were somewhat genius when looking at the cost average of the previously retired shares.

Unlike other companies out there that talk about stock buybacks but then don't do a great job of reducing the share count due to stock options and overly generous management compensation packages, Apple has done a fantastic job of reducing its outstanding shares. Over the last 5 years, Apple has reduced its float by nearly 19%. In the company's recent Q4 alone, it retired 1.5% of its common stock. Being that Apple seems to want to be a dividend grower over the long term, each and every one of these shares retired represents significant savings for the company moving forward.

Another thing to consider when talking about buybacks from DGI companies, especially those early on in their growth phase, is that every share retired is one less (growing) dividend payment that the company will be responsible for. Right now, Apple pays a $2.28 annual dividend per share. The company has retired ~1.2b shares since 2012 when the dividend was announced. Think about those cost savings. Assuming we see another ~10% dividend increase in 2017, Apple will be saving approximately $3b a year, just on dividends.

Using a ~10% annual dividend growth rate and looking out to 2020, we see that Apple shares would be paying ~3.40/share in annual dividends. This equates to a 2.5% YOC for those buying shares at today's $137 price. If the company were to stop its buyback today (something that I think would be VERY unlikely), we see that the 2020 savings on dividends when thinking about retired shares would be ~$4b/year. Factoring in continued share repurchases, I wouldn't be surprised to see this figure come in about $5b or even $6b per year. Some may be thinking that this is chump change for a company with a $715b market cap, though the numbers just continue to compound over time and dividend savings is just one small benefit of the share buyback program.

As Apple's growth slows, which undoubtedly will, barring some sort of new breakthrough in an industry outside of the smartphone space, the company will need to continue to focus on efficiency measures like this. People call this sort of thing financial engineering and paint it with a negative light, though so long as financial engineering helps to line my pockets with sustainable dividends over the years, I don't mind it one bit. I'd much rather see this company buy back its own shares knowing full and well what sort of value and cash flow yields it is receiving, rather than wasting cash on speculative bets or overpaying for bolt-on acquisitions like we so often see, especially in the tech space.

Comparing Apple to DGI Aristocrats

I know that I said this piece would be primarily focused on the company's shareholder returns, though due to the fact that I'm calling Apple the world's greatest DGI opportunity, I'm going to make my case for this company against the likes of classic DGI stocks: the well known, steady and reliable, consumer staple plays that we all feel so comfortable owning.

When investors think of blue chip DGI companies, names like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), or Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) come to mind (or, at least they do for me). Apple isn't selling food, or laundry detergent, or toothpaste, but I will argue that the technology that Apple sells has become just as much of a staple of our everyday lives as those items.

Imagine a day without your smartphone, seriously  that's not a very good day, is it? Yes, it's a luxury, but so is drinking tasty carbonated sugary drinks instead of water or washing your clothes/teeth with name brands rather than your local super market's store brand. Apple is widely considered to be a luxury brand, and sure, knock-offs will come along as this technology is increasingly commoditized, though like Coke, or Tide, or Colgate, I think it's likely that consumers will continue to flock towards quality instead of the generic brands of the world. When it comes down to it, can you imagine a product that is more of a staple in today's consumers' everyday lives more than a smartphone?

I know Apple faces competition in this space from worthy competitors, but so does Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Colgate-Palmolive in theirs. Apple doesn't need to own the entire pie, it just needs to carve out a hefty chunk and continue to sell 10s of millions of devices every year. I remember reading this piece on CNBC about the future of the smartphone market; all in all, the growth story remains in place, and this seems to be a very good area of the market to do business in.

So long as Apple keeps its devices in the hands of consumers, essentially inventing a slightly better mousetrap every 2-3 years, it will continue to generate massive cash flows. What's more, the devices in consumers hands will allow for revenues from the ecosystem that Apple has created and continually re-invents will continue to grow, giving the company higher margin sales that should bolster its P/E multiple and help to grow the dividend.

Valuation

This last bit, about the expanding P/E multiple, is another factor in my ranking of Apple at the top of the DGI totem pole. While many of the slow (or negative) growth consumer staples names trade for more than 20x their forward earnings estimates, Apple, even after its recent run from $90 to $137, still trades with a relatively cheap 15.3x forward multiple. While certain DGI guys and gals don't care as much about valuation or capital gains (focusing primarily on income, rather than fundamental metrics), I do. I have a fairly long investing horizon, and therefore, I think that when you factor in the likelihood of continued dividend growth and capital gains when looking at Apple, it becomes very attractive compared to many of the more established DGI names.

Source: F.A.S.T Graphs

I know that a lot of this low multiple is due to the fact that historically hardware companies have been given lower multiples due to high competition and low margins; however, Apple has bucked this margin trend for years now and should continue to do so as its service revenue continues to grow. I can easily imagine a day when this stock trades for 20x, which would mean massive share price increases. Apple has a massive cash hoard, which means that it essentially has the opportunity to enter into any new market that it wants to. There have been rumors of the company following the likes of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) into original content. Well, media companies typically trade with much higher multiples than hardware companies, so I welcome this potential foray (heck, if Apple really wanted to, it could simply buy Netflix and REALLY grow its service revenues).

This is just one of many possible examples of Apple using its cash to grow the business and put a fire under its share price. It's fun to think about what I would do with hundreds of billions of dollars, but really, that's neither here nor there. I trust that Cook and Co. will do what's right for this company; this trust is why I feel comfortable holding so many Apple shares.

Conclusion: What Do You Think?

So, up to this point, I think I've made myself pretty clear: I'm a huge Apple bull. Even though FerdiS' work proved that DYI DGI investors are becoming more and more bullish on Apple as well, it's obvious that I'm in the minority having this company as my largest holding. I'm interested to know which companies are your favorites to hold. I'm interested in hearing further arguments for, and against, this Apple as the top DGI pick thesis, moving forward. Until next time, best wishes all!

Apple Inc.'s "Super Cycle" Problem Later this year, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to launch new smartphones that will, per some analysts, catalyze a "super cycle" -- essentially a significant acceleration in iPhone shipment growth because of a major fundamental change to the phones.

The last such super cycle was the iPhone 6 cycle. Apple was late to bringing large-screen smartphones to market, which led to significant pent-up demand for large-screen iPhones. Once Apple finally delivered them -- in late 2014, Apple released two large-screen phones (iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus) -- the company enjoyed substantial iPhone unit and average selling price growth.

After this super cycle, sales of Apple's iPhone 6s series of smartphones were poor, driving the company's first-ever year-over-year iPhone unit decline. The iPhone 7 series appeared to be getting off to a good start, but now we are seeing several analysts trimming their estimates as negative supply chain data comes in.

Apple bull Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley, for example, just reduced iPhone revenue estimates for the current fiscal year (units down 7%, partially offset by 4% increase in estimated average selling prices) due to "weaker iPhone 7 demand" (though she notes that iPhone 7 Plus is stronger).

However, Huberty, like many Street analysts, is expecting that the iPhones released later this year will catalyze an iPhone 6-like super cycle. Huberty, for example, expects Apple to ship 253 million iPhones in fiscal year 2018 (up 20% year over year) with average selling price growth of 6%.

All this talk about super cycles, though, leads me to wonder the following: Can Apple find a way to grow iPhone unit shipments and revenue between these so-called super cycles?

Killing the super cycle

The harsh reality is that the main reason that these super cycles ever happen is that Apple's product development methodology leads to the company delivering products that are, on the surface, very similar for at least two generations (three, in the case of the iPhone 6, 6s, and 7).

That's not to insult the hard work that Apple's engineers put into each new generation of devices; under the hood, Apple's iPhone 6s was a solid jump from the iPhone 6, and the iPhone 7 was a nice improvement from the iPhone 6s.

The engineering of Apple's latest phones is superb -- the displays are excellent, the applications processor generations ahead of the competition in some ways, and much more -- but the phones have the same general look and feel as iPhones from 2014 and 2015.

Here's the problem, though -- does the average smartphone buyer care about all of the fine work that went into engineering the latest iPhones?

Do average consumers really care beforehand (and this part of it is key) that the chip inside of the iPhone 7 runs circles around the one in the aging iPhone 6 that they're using? Probably not. But it is the sort of thing that a consumer can come to appreciate once she or he has purchased the new phone for other reasons (such as, "I like how it looks").

Consumers seem to be attracted to devices with thinner bezels than the ones found on the current iPhone models, and curved displays also seem to be in vogue. OLED displays, too, are becoming more popular, even in non-curved smartphones.

With the next-generation iPhones, Apple is rumored to deliver these aesthetic and technical changes/improvements, which is why so many are counting on a super cycle.

By introducing these features, Apple not only serves to stop current iPhone users from defecting to competing devices, but it can also bring people back who had switched precisely because Apple wasn't delivering the "whiz-bang" features and aesthetics that they were looking for.

In other words, pretty much exactly what happened when Apple finally introduced larger iPhones.

By now, it should be very clear how Apple can kill the super cycle -- it needs to make aesthetic/design changes at a faster pace. A new aesthetic every two years was already pushing it, but forcing customers to wait three years simply seems to be too much.

These changes don't even need to be sweeping generation-over-generation, but they need to be noticeable to the average smartphone buyer.

If Apple can do that, then the super cycle concept will die, and along with it, the uncomfortable boom/bust cycles that Apple's iPhone business suffers over multiyear periods. Why I'd Be Terrified of Apple, Inc. Acquiring Netflix People have been speculating about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) acquiring Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) since the dawn of time. While there are some valid strategic rationales for doing so, the financial justification for such a deal would be untenable largely because of Netflix's lofty valuation.

Consider the fact that Netflix's current enterprise value is around $60 billion, even before factoring in some sort of acquisition premium. That's already about 20 times as large as Apple's biggest acquisition to date, the $3 billion purchase of Beats in 2014. The size of the Beats deal was itself unprecedented, about six times as large as any Apple acquisition before it. A Netflix acquisition also would be extremely dilutive to margins (Netflix's net margin is about one-tenth of Apple's).

Beyond all of that, there are signs that Apple is looking to dabble in original video content. While the company has explicitly stated that it has no intention of competing directly with video streaming services, instead clarifying that any original video content would serve as a differentiator for Apple Music, Apple's growing interest in video will only spark even more speculation about a possible Netflix acquisition going forward. Meanwhile, CEO Tim Cook has said that price will no longer be a limiting factor for potential acquisitions. Here's Cook just a few months ago on the November earnings call:

We are open to acquisitions of any size that are of strategic value where we can deliver better products to our customers and innovate more. And so we look at a whole variety of companies, and based on that, we choose whether to move forward or not. But we're definitely open and we definitely look.

So yeah, I'd expect the speculation over a Netflix acquisition to only intensify from here. Here's why that terrifies me.

An unflattering comparison

To be clear, I'm a shareholder of both companies, and as such my Netflix position would benefit quite nicely if Apple were to scoop up the dominant video streamer at a hefty premium. Yet if that ever came to fruition, I'd be scared of what that says about Apple.

If Apple were to acquire Netflix, it would be an incontrovertible admission on Apple's part that it's running out of ideas for its core business, and the expansion via acquisition into online video streaming services would not only be ridiculously expensive but also desperate. We've seen this play out before. When growth companies start to mature, organic growth becomes more elusive and management teams sometimes turn to blockbuster acquisitions as a way to get investors excited again, buying growth in new markets instead of creating it organically.

In general, the risk that an acquiring company takes is commensurate with the price tag, since the magnitude of the premium directly affects how much goodwill is subsequently recorded on the balance sheet -- goodwill that may be written down and impaired if the deal fails to create value. Even now, the book value of Netflix's shareholder equity is just $2.5 billion.

Furthermore, it's not as if Apple investors are pricing in considerable growth expectations right now. Shares are currently trading at just 14.4 times earnings and 2.9 times sales, far cheaper than peers. You might argue that Apple could spur multiple expansion if it increased investor growth expectations (such as with an acquisition), but the flip side could be that investors hate the deal because of the financial implications and what it says about Apple's ability to innovate on its own, which may send shares lower and contract its valuation multiples. It's rather common for shares of acquiring companies to fall when they announce deals due to investor skepticism, particularly large ones. They bigger they are, the harder they fall.

If Apple were to ever announce this mythical Netflix acquisition, I would consider it the first sign that Apple may indeed entering a lost decade similar to what its software rival from Redmond experienced in the early 2000s. It wouldn't be a coincidence that that company's lost decade included numerous blockbuster acquisitions, many of which failed and collectively resulted in tens of billions of dollars in shareholder value destruction. Note that the initial rationales for many of those deals wouldn't be dissimilar to why many believe that Apple should acquire Netflix.

One of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most important component suppliers is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short. TSMC is believed to be the sole manufacturer of the Apple-designed A10 applications processor that powers the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and it also builds chips for many chips that Apple procured from third-party suppliers, to boot.

On TSMC's most recent earnings call, analyst Charlie Chan asked TSMC Chairman Morris Chang the following question:

My first question is regarding the advisory reports to the U.S. President this Friday, because in a report, the U.S. seems want to ensure their semiconductor leadership, especially in the leading-edge, so what will be TSMC's strategy to beating this policy direction and ensure your own leadership? Thanks.

Chang had a very extensive answer in which the key message is this: TSMC has created "hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States in the last 20-30 years of [its] existence."

How could a chip manufacturer that owns and operates no manufacturing plants in the United States create so many jobs in this country? Let's take a closer look.

Building an industry

Chang began by explaining that TSMC "for all practical purposes" created the fabless semiconductor industry model. Early in the life of the semiconductor industry, a company that wanted to design and sell chips also had to build those chips. As the complexity and costs associated with chip manufacturing grew, it became increasingly impractical for chip designers -- especially smaller ones -- to afford to own and operate their own chip manufacturing plants.

What TSMC did is recognize that, while many chipmakers individually didn't have the scale to develop new chip manufacturing techniques and spend all the money to build out manufacturing capacity, many small chipmakers, in aggregate, could provide the necessary revenue and unit scale to make chip manufacturing feasible.

By enabling virtually any chipmaker, large or small, access to robust chip manufacturing technologies and sufficient capacity, TSMC created a ton of value for its shareholders, and made it possible for more chip companies to emerge and even prosper.

With that background in mind, we can now understand Chang's job-creation argument.

Fabless semiconductor industry employs many

"The fabless industry, I believe, employs hundreds of thousands of people in the United States," Chang explained on the call. A fabless semiconductor company, as is implied by the name, is a chipmaker that relies on third parties to manufacture its chips, since chip-manufacturing plants are often called "fabs" -- short for "fabrication plants."

"So, I think we'll continue to create more jobs in the United States by helping the fabless industry in the United States," Chang added.

The executive also made another good point: It isn't just fabless semiconductor companies that rely on TSMC for chip-manufacturing services -- there are chipmakers that run their own manufacturing plants based in the United States that rely on TSMC for manufacturing services.

Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which brings in about twice the annual revenue that TSMC does, is a prime example of a chipmaker that owns its own manufacturing plants -- many of which are based in the United State -- but still relies on TSMC to manufacture some of its products, such as wireless chips.

These aren't manufacturing jobs in the United States that TSMC has created, but because TSMC allows many chipmakers to operate and thrive without needing to own and operate their own chip plants, the semiconductor industry can support a broader, more diverse range of companies.

Those companies often employ many individuals in the United States, including chip-design engineers, engineers who work closely with TSMC to build their products, product marketing, and much more.

Some examples of large United States-based employers that rely on TSMC for the manufacture of some, if not all, of its chips include Qualcomm, the leading merchant mobile chipmaker, and smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which has large chip-development operations in California and Texas. Apple: It's All About The User Base You have heard it all before - Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) benefits from a large, robust and loyal installed base of iPhones users. This locks in future replacements and recurring cash flows that provide significant downside protection and the potential introduction of new products and services provides a free option.

My analysis adds value by diving deep into the installed base and related key drivers. In turn, I will show that Apple is significantly undervalued even if future cash flows are significantly reduced in my conservative and unlikely base case (free cash flow FY16A-17F: -16%).

I assume no more growth in the iPhone's user base and no more successful product introductions in the foreseeable future despite Apple's continuously demonstrated innovative characteristics and its perceived highly talented workforce and management team.

Numerous other contributors have provided insightful analysis on Apple's innovative capabilities including autonomous driving cars and the iPhone's unrealised potential. Countered by this bear article.

Steady installed base of 520m iPhone users assumed from FY16 onwards

As such, the only iPhones sold from now on would be replacement units to existing customers and there are no more net Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) switchers to the Apple universe. This assumption is considered conservative given market research by Gartner:

"We expect the market for premium smartphones to return to 3.5 per cent growth in 2017, as stronger replacement cycles kick in and in anticipation of a new iPhone next year, which is expected to offer a new design and new features that are attractive enough to convince more replacement buyers"

In addition, CIRP indicates that 17% of iPhone 7/7 Plus buyers in the U.S. stepped over from Android devices (as per 16th November 2016 -no reverse switching data is available), and the market share of iOS in the U.S. increased by 7% to 40.5% L3M October 2016.

Unfortunately, Apple has not disclosed a breakdown other than the wider iOS and OS X environment surpassing 1bn active units in January 2016. Gartner estimated a total installed base of >500m active iPhones in the first half of 2016. I since checked this number in my model applying several replacement cycles over the past years.

It can be disputed that my assumed installed base number is too low, and a quick search on news outlets, blogs and sell-side research suggests more optimistic views of 550-630m units in 2015-16.

The replacement cycle extends from 2.5 to 2.7 years in the forecast period

A challenge to my investment thesis is the potential lack of innovation in smartphones and in turn the decreased addition of new features. As a result, consumers could hold on longer to their iPhone before buying the latest version. This risk was recently highlighted by well-known venture capitalist Peter Thiel who dramatically stated that the "Age of Apple" is over, yet his assertion is highly debatable as argued in this Seeking Alpha article.

However, repurchase cycles seem already to fully incorporate the assumed slowdown in new innovative features for the last couple of years. The elongation of the repurchase cycle seems to have stabilized at 2-2.5 years in the U.S. since 2014 after an increase by circa three months in 2013-14 (source: below CIRP figure roughly translated into the underlying numbers). Furthermore, Gartner states replacement cycles of 2.5 and 2.2-2.5 years of premium devices in mature and emerging markets respectively, and overall it expects no substantial shifts in the next five years.

Age of Previous iPhone of iPhone Buyers (trailing twelve months):

Source: CIRP, 7th June 2016

My assumption is conservatively on the high end of the indicated 2-2.5 year range, and the projected cycle is further extended over time. Further comfort is taken from the fact that the cycle has to be drastically stretched to almost 4.5 years in my base case before my valuation reaches the current share price of $119 at the time of writing.

Base case or bear case - iPhone sales going down

Source: Apple, contributor assumptions

All my conservative assumptions combined result unsurprisingly in depressed future sales numbers.

Source: Apple; contributor assumptions

The average sales price is projected to remain USD 619 per unit from FY17 onwards in line with 4Q16 performance. A potential adverse shift in product mix due to the SE model is assumed to be fully absorbed in the average 4Q16 pricing. Any potential inflationary increase of sales prices is also excluded. Although I believe this to be fully offset by the risk of increased price competition.

Base case shows robust free cash flows

Source: Apple; contributor assumptions. Notes: 1. effective tax rate: 25-26% p.a.; no deferred income tax expense add-backs included; 2. FY17 one-off lump sum payment of approximately $14bn relates to the EU tax ruling; 3. excludes add-backs regarding share-based compensation schemes (FY16: $4.2bn); not all FY16A cash flow items are presented in the table

Free cash flow is roughly $42bn p.a. in the projection period (excluding the one-off lump sum in FY17) which is significantly below FY16A performance due to:

Decreasing iPhone sales partly offset by other products and services.

Margin pressure of 1.1% from FY17 onwards reflecting competition risk and potentially increased manufacturing costs.

Base Case valuation - USD 140 per share

Source: contributor assumptions

The valuation implies an upside of 18% compared to the current share price. More importantly, investing in Apple is highly attractive with a significant margin of safety even in the case of using conservative assumptions.

Harsh and unlikely sensitivity scenario underlines significant downside protection

Although I believe that the current base case is already sufficiently depressed, a more sensitized case is helpful to further assess the downside risk and test the robustness of my assumptions.

Let's see which events we have to plug in to get to the current share price:

The installed base is decreased to 500m iPhones.

The replacement cycle is immediately extended to 3.0 years in FY17.

The average sales price is reduced by 10% to $581 per device in FY17 onwards.

EBITDA margin is further scaled down by 2% in the period.

As a result, projected free cash flow contracts significantly to $32-35bn p.a.

Closing remarks

Apple's shareholders require more granular insight into the key installed base and the overall replacement cycle in order to fully appreciate the business. I urge Apple to disclose this key information instead of providing some soft hints on an irregular basis.

I believe that Apple is an attractive investment with significant downside protection. That said, the underlying value is capped due to no imminent landmark product introductions coupled with the reliance of my investment thesis on the iPhone - do not expect a multi-bagger. Apple Q1 Guidance Review: The Trend Is Your Friend 2016 will be remembered for a lot of things. While some were figuring out if they were deplorable or not, most of us were just plain tired of the continual political barrage found on our social and news media. Some of us who follow Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were figuring out that this stock was also tired and maybe not capable of the quantum leaps of the past. A look at the monthly average daily volume for 2016 shows a continuation of the long-term declining trend (Source: StockCharts.com):

The excitement isn't there. Even on this site, the number of Apple-related articles declined. From the October earnings announcement through the end of the year, there were only 109 articles. That number was 154 six months earlier.

Since the last earnings announcement on October 25th, Apple's stock dipped 10% before closing the year at relatively the same level of the last quarter. With all of the hoopla of Dow 20,000 during this time frame, you would think this Dow 30 stock and former market mover would take part. It did not (To be fair, some of Apple's cohorts on the Dow also did not fully participate in the nearly 9% run-up over this time frame. Stocks like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Merck (NYSE:MRK), Nike (NYSE:NKE), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), Visa (NYSE:V) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) did not really take part either).

But yet, as the stock continues to trudge through the doldrums, many Apple "bulls" still look upon Cupertino to lead us to the stock market nirvana. As I always have said, I prefer to rely on facts and numbers to formulate my own opinion and consequent investment plans.

My article analyzing the Q3 numbers lead me to project Apple's earnings for Q4 to be $1.68 per diluted share. Apple reported $1.67 per share. Close enough in my book. Let's see if we can figure out where Q1 will be going using history, Apple's guidance and a little common sense. Data was taken from a number of sources as noted and including AAPL's earnings transcript on the Seeking Alpha website (here), Apple's website, and the 10-K and 10-Qs found at SEC.gov.

Q4 Results - Revenue

Apple reported Q4 revenue to be $46.852 billion, a 9.0% decline from Q4 2015, but in line with the range of guidance from the previous quarter. The company began providing a range of revenue for its guidance starting with Q2 of 2013. In those 15 quarters, Apple has never missed the low end of its guidance. In fact, actual revenue has averaged 6.9% higher than the low-end guidance for these 15 reported quarters. Last quarter was 3.0% over the low-end guidance of $45.5 billion.

Q4 Results - Gross Margin

The gross margin for Q4 was identical to that of Q3 at 38.02%. This put the fiscal year gross margin at 39.1%. Like revenue, since Q2 of 2013 when Apple began guiding a range for gross margin, the reported number has never been below the low guidance. This quarter came in just over the high guidance of 38.0%, at 38.02% (Let's not forget, .02% doesn't sound like much, but in real dollars this equates to $11 million towards profits).

Q4 Results - Operating Expenses

Since its guidance epiphany that Apple had back in Q2 of 2013, Apple has provided guidance for operating expenses in an expected range. For these 15 quarters, it has never seriously come close to the high end of its guidance. In fact, the 15-quarter average is just 0.1% over the low-end guidance. This past quarter was no exception. Apple had guided operating expenses to be up a little from the previous quarter to a range between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion. The expenses came in at $6.052 billion.

Q4 Results - Other Income (Expense)

Q4's other income for Apple came in significantly higher than the $350 million that it gave as guidance for the quarter. The quarter saw other income come in $77 million more than expected at $427 million. This area has been a tough area for Apple to guide as the range of difference to guidance is all over the map. The good news is that this entry has only been an expense once in the last 32 quarters (Q4 2012).

Q4 Results - Tax Rate

Apple's provision for taxes in Q4 came in at 26.04%. This was considerably higher than its guidance of 25.5%. Perhaps I should rescind my statement from last quarter's analysis because it does not look like Apple's tax department had its act together when forecasting the guidance for Q4. The tax rate for the fiscal year did come in at 25.56%.

Q4 Results - Share Count

As pointed out in previous articles, there are three share counts Apple reports in its quarterly and annual reports. The header of the report includes the share count at the time it completes (internally) the report. This number was reported as of 10/14/16 and was 5,332,313,000. This was down 56,120,000 (1.04%) from the previous quarter, which is slightly less than the average post-split quarterly drop of 1.28%.

The share count used to determine earnings per share, which is a weighted average (see Note 1 of the 10-K notes to consolidated financial statements), increased 0.5% (27,500,000 shares) to 5,500,281,000 (fully diluted). This increase is typical to the last four annual reports.

The third share count reported by Apple is the one used to determine shareholders' equity as of the close of the quarter. This was reported as 5,578,753,000, up 3.44% from the previous quarter, an increase of 185,588,000 shares. This is the first increase since the split in Q3 of 2014. Since one quarter does not make a trend, I will leave further prognostication on this to the Seeking Alpha comment nation.

Q4 Results - Earnings Per Share

For Q4, diluted EPS came in at $1.67. Using Apple's guidance numbers and last quarter's ending share balance, the expected range was between $1.51 and $1.66 per share. Summarized in the table below are the pertinent numbers regarding Q4 guidance, our projections, and the Q4 actual:

Q4 Review Category Apple Guidance My Projection Apple Actual Revenue - Low $45.5 billion $46.638 billion $46.852 billion Revenue - High $47.5 billion Gross Margin - Low 37.5% 38.37% 38.02% Gross Margin - High 38.0% Expenses - Low $6.05 billion $6.097 billion $6.052 billion Expenses - High $6.15 billion Other Income (Expense) $350 million $350 million $427 million Tax Rate 25.5% 25.5% 26.04% Share count - Diluted EPS Not Provided 5,380,000,000 5,500,281,000 Surprise Not Applicable $0.00 $0.02 Earnings Per Share Not Provided $1.68 $1.67

Projections for Q1

In the following paragraphs, I will present my analysis for each of the guidance numbers as we head into Apple's Q1 earnings announcement next week.

My Projections for Q1 - Revenue

When I look at the history of actual to guidance over the last 16 quarters, the average difference between actual and the low guidance is 6.44%. This number is propped up by outliers that occurred in the Q4 2014 to Q2 2015 time frame. The same holds true for the difference between the high guidance and actual coming in at 1.45% over high guidance. This is propped up by an outlier that occurred in Q1 of 2015.

Quarter Low Guidance High Guidance Actual Q2 2013 $41.0B $43.0B $43.603B Q3 2013 $33.5B $35.5B $35.323B Q4 2013 $34.0B $37.0B $37.472B Q1 2014 $55.0B $58.0B $57.594B Q2 2014 $42.0B $44.0B $45.646B Q3 2014 $36.0B $38.0B $37.432B Q4 2014 $37.0B $40.0B $42.123B Q1 2015 $63.5B $65.5B $74.599B Q2 2015 $52.0B $55.0B $58.010B Q3 2015 $46.0B $48.0B $49.605B Q4 2015 $49.0B $51.0B $51.501B Q1 2016 $75.5B $77.5B $75.872B Q2 2016 $50.0B $53.0B $50.557B Q3 2016 $41.0B $43.0B $42.358B Q4 2016 $45.5B $47.5B $46.852B Q1 2017 $76.0B $78.0B

Over the past four quarters, actual over low guidance has been a "mere" 2.0%. In keeping with my premise that Apple is now a much more mature company, I believe that this is a more reasonable approach to the revenue number. My projection for Q1 revenue is 2% over low guidance or $77.52 billion.

My Projections for Q1 - Gross Margin

History repeated itself. For Q3 and Q4, Apple guided gross margin to be between 37.5% and 38.0%. Both times, the actual came in at 38.02%. This also marks the 14th quarter in a row where gross margin exceeded the low guidance. It is also the 12th out of the last 13 quarters that gross margin has exceeded the high guidance.

For Q1, Apple has raised the bar slightly to guide gross margin in the 38.0% to 38.5% range. I am going to go with a continued beat to the high side matching the 15-quarter average of plus 0.35%, giving an expected gross margin of 38.6%.

My Projections for Q1 - Operating Expenses

The trend continued for operating expenses. Since Q2 of 2013, when Apple began providing a range for its guidance of this parameter, the actual has yet to exceed the high end of the range. I would certainly expect that trend to continue. The average operating expenses to revenue ratio for Q1 is 8.92%. Using my expected revenue number of $77.52B, this puts operating expenses at $6.915B. This fits the trend and is in line with Apple's guidance of $6.9 to $7.0 billion, so I will go with this number.

My Projections for Q1 - Other Income

This item, although small in the bigger picture of earnings, is the one parameter that doesn't seem to be able to be trending or for that matter even capable of trending. The actual can be off by 50% in either direction from guidance. For lack of a better number, listening and using Apple guidance for this parameter is probably best.

My Projections for Q1 - Tax Rate

The tax rate for Q4 came in much higher than the rest of the year at 26.04%. Apple has reflected this increase in its guidance by going a full half point higher than each of the last three quarters, settling on 26.0%. Fiscal 2016 was the first year since fiscal 2012 where the tax rate was less than 26.0%.

Anyone following Apple realizes that taxes are a complicated matter for this company. With the ongoing Ireland/EU tax case pending resolution, appeals and potential U.S. problems with those findings, this is one parameter that could continue to fluctuate and take many more quarters to resolve. For that reason, I will accept Apple's guidance on this as well, going with a 26.0% tax rate for Q1.

My Projections for Q1 - Share Count

Apple's share count is dependent on the open market, its accelerated share repurchase (ASR) plan, other repurchases, and its employee purchase and compensation plans. For purposes of this exercise, I use the weighted average shares outstanding which is used to calculate earnings per share.

Apple does not provide a quarterly breakdown for the weighted average shares by quarter in its 10-K annual report. I backed into this number using the rest of its parameters and came up with a Q4 weighted share count of 5,396,000,000. This puts the share count drop to 76,624,000 for the quarter or approximately 1.4%. The average quarterly decline in share count for fiscal 2016 is slightly lower at 1.27%. This is in line with fiscal 2015's average quarterly drop of 1.25%. Both Q4 and Q1 drops have been the higher points of the year since the split, so I think a repeat of Q4 is in order with a 1.4% drop. This puts my projection for Q1 at 5,320,611,000 for weighted average share.

My Projections for an Earnings Surprise for Q1

Q1 of 2017 is a 14-week quarter. Will this result in an earnings surprise? Let's look at some facts and questions we must answer to determine if a surprise is probable.

Q1 has historically been the quarter of surprise even when the other quarters don't measure up. Apple announced record-breaking App Store sales for New Year's Day (falls in fiscal Q2) and called it a "record breaking holiday season". For 11 out of the last 16 quarters, actual EPS exceeds EPS calculated from Apple's guidance. EPS for the last three quarters has not exceeded the high-end EPS calculated from Apple's guidance. Note: The basis for last quarter's finding regarding the surprise factor. The continued exuberance of the market - irrational or not? Will market exuberance translate into consumer confidence and how much of a benefit has this been to Apple?

Based on my beliefs, I would think a surprise is probable. The question then becomes how much. The trend for Q1 surprise is declining rapidly - from 47.4% five years ago to just 2.6% a year ago. The five-year average stands at 19.6%. I'm inclined to go with a continuation of a moderate surprise, i.e., one equal to last year at 2.6%.

Wrapping It All Up - The Q1 Projections

In the table below, I've shown Apple's guidance and my projections for Q1 and calculated out the projected Q1 earnings per share. Because Apple does not guide on share count, I provided a few options for that parameter.

Parameter Apple Guidance for Q1 My projections for Q1 Revenue $76.0-78.0 Billion $77.52 Billion Gross Margin 38.0-38.5% 38.6% Expenses $6.9-7.0 Billion $6.915 billion Other Income (Expense) $400 million $400 million Tax Rate 26.0% 26.0% Share count No Guidance Provided 5,320,611,000 Earnings per Share using Shares outstanding on 10/14/16 $3.09-3.27 Earnings per share using my Projection for Q1 $3.10-3.27 per diluted share $3.26 per diluted share Surprise 2.6% Consensus $3.22 per diluted share My projection $3.34 per diluted share

Potential Effect on the Stock Price

From September 21st's Q4 close through the close on the day of the earnings call, Apple's stock gained $5.54 (4.9%) to close at $118.25 per share. A week after the election, Apple hit a low for the quarter at $104.08. On the Q1 close of 12/31/16, the stock closed at $115.82, a gain of $3.11 or 2.76% for the fiscal quarter. Meanwhile, its peers on the Dow Jones Industrial Average overcame this lackluster performance ( and others as well) to post an 8.2% gain over the same time frame.

As of this writing (1/15), the current P/E for Apple is 14.39 ($8.27 TTM earnings - Barron's). It continues to lag its peers on the DJ Industrial Average which sports a 21.68 P/E (according to WSJ.com). Using consensus earnings adds .1 to the P/E to 14.49 at the current close of $119.04. I doubt that hitting consensus would raise the bar and allow the stock price to break the resistance levels just above $120.00.

On the other hand, an upside surprise based on my predicted EPS would lower the P/E by .1 to 14.29 and may give enough impetus to push the P/E towards 15 and break those resistance levels. A P/E of 15 using my predicted EPS would put the stock at $124.95.

Of course there are many ongoing big picture issues that can have effects on macro movements of the market which could translate into further exuberance, or the possible doomsday decline that everyone was expecting. There has been an underlying battle between the Apple Bears and Bulls as to which direction the stock will move. This battle continues and will probably rear itself in the comments section once again.

Or then, there is stagnancy. Let's face it. If you bought Apple at the closing price on December 5, 2015, over 13 months ago, you'd only be better off by a penny (plus dividends). In fact you could go back 10 more months to Feb. 2nd and be only better off by a dime (plus another couple of bucks in dividends). And this is where I think we are at. It's a solid company. It pays a decent dividend. It may soon be able to repatriate some of its hoard of cash and do something with it. So, buy it for the maturity. Buy it for the covered call opportunities. Buy it for the sustained dividend. Buy it for the hope and glimmer that a technology giant with the cash and capability to innovate has the real possibility to reinvent itself from a phone manufacturer into the next thing you and I have to have.

Apple: Why We Expect New All-Time Highs In 2017 We lay out the whole line of positive catalysts for Apple and explain simply why we should see new all-time highs in 2017.

By Scott Tzu with Thom Lachenmann

A secular shift has been taking place on the technology landscape and it has been so slow moving and difficult to notice that nobody seems to care. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices are finally overtaking Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows devices, marking the end of a decades-long era where Windows was the assumed dominant operating system and Apple was always second in the industry. While tough to make out, Mac OS X is now elbowing its way into Windows territory.

Yes, Apple has come a long way since the ugly Microsoft bailout at Macworld 1997.

And when it comes to what operating system users are using to bridge the gap between phone and device, iOS is clearly paving the way. As you can see in the below chart from Statista, phones that use both Wi-Fi and Mobile are dominated by iOS, showing the strength that the mobile platform has to potentially move users into tablets, and eventually, computers. It's a natural progression from one product to the next. This is what gives Apple its strength in total sales.

We wanted to touch upon this briefly today and also talk about some long term, mid term and near-term catalysts as to why we think Apple will soon be through its all-time highs and moving higher before 2017 comes to a close.

BGR reported last week that Apple will finally have overtaken Windows in terms of total devices sold. This is news of a serious proportion, so we were a bit surprised when we didn't see it mentioned on any of the technology blogs that we read. The article stated,

Windows vs Mac is just about the oldest battle in computer fanboy history. Right-click sheeple against computers that just barely work is a flame war for the ages. But in the history of the rivalry, it's always been accepted that Windows will be sole on more devices. Quality vs quantity is a defining feature of the disagreement. But starting in 2017, it looks like things might change as Apple steals one of Windows's most important stats. According to analysts at Gartner, sales of Apple devices (that's iOS and macOS, not just MacBooks) will eclipse Windows sales for the first time this year. Windows has held a diminishing lead for years, but 2017 looks to be the year the tide finally turns. Gartner is forecasting Apple to sell 268 million iOS and macOS devices this year, an increase of 8% on 2016 numbers. That's a big jump, but if you consider that Apple just released the long-awaited MacBook Pro update, and is set to release a big iPhone update this year, that's not unrealistic.

This means a couple of things for Apple. It diversifies them as a company, it will change attitudes about using Apple products in environments where they are not popular, and it could mark the beginning of another golden age for Apple investors. With Apple taking on original content and showing signs of becoming a media company, coupled with the fact that there may be tax incentives for the company to repatriate some of its offshore cash, we believe that Apple has both short-term and long-term appeal for investors, and that is why we are long.

Let's look at the first reason why this shift is important. Apple is pretty much known now on the street exclusively as a smartphone company. The iPhone generates a good portion of the company's business and it is subsequently scrutinized all year round. Not only is it scrutinized as new models come out and are released, but suppliers for all of its parts are also scrutinized year-round in order to try and get a picture on how the phone has produced, will produce, and will be producing in the future. This narrative helps to diversify Apple a little bit more by adding focus to the company's other line of products.

While the iPhone is always going to be incredibly important and part of the lifeblood of the business, the supplemental roles played by MacBook, iMac, and now the App store and the iTunes store will come further into focus as Apple looks for these types of niches to capture in order to move forward with new growth avenues.

This shift also changes the narrative about the company for younger generations. When we were coming up through high school and university, Windows was simply the standard. While some art students and educators used Apple products, it was not considered to be a serious product for working professionals. Take, for instance, data collected in the early 2010s showing which operating system college students at the time preferred,

As Apple now shifts to become the standard in the industry, these niche markets are going to have no choice but to re-examine Apple potentially playing a role at their respective workplaces or specialty outfits. With Apple's recent enterprise partnerships with both IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Microsoft, the company has proven that it can also be a tool in the workplace and the number of Apple products that we see in the financial industry, while still small, has increased meaningfully over the last few years.

To walk into a hedge fund's office and see anything other than Windows-based terminals and Bloomberg terminals used to be an impossibility. Now, it's becoming reality. Moving into 2016, the company had already built a $25 billion enterprise business.

As these shifts continue to take place and Apple finds opportunities for business in pockets where it previously hasn't, it could be one of many factors that contribute to the beginning of a new golden era for Apple investors. While the shift of the technology landscape is a longer-term catalyst, we believe that there exists several short-term catalysts that could be beneficial to Apple investors and could drive the stock to and through its all-time highs in relatively short order.

One potentially positive catalyst is the Trump administration making it easier for companies to repatriate cash into the United States. As most investors know, most of Apple's cash is domiciled overseas and any tax breaks that may make it easier for the company to bring some of this cash back into the United States would easily be a positive for shareholders, as it is assumed that at least a portion of this cash would continue going towards shareholder-friendly initiatives like buybacks and dividends. Bloomberg wrote back in November that this repatriation would stand to benefit investors the most:

The president-elect has suggested that cutting taxes on companies' accumulated offshore earnings from the current 35 percent to 10 percent would persuade them to repatriate that income; as the money returned, so would jobs. In fact, the capital is more likely to benefit investors than jobseekers. It's not a shortage of funds that has held back job creation by U.S. companies. Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Pfizer Inc. and many others have raised huge amounts of cash -- using low-interest debt -- to buy back shares and boost dividends, not build new factories in the U.S. Asked what he would do with repatriated cash should the Trump administration slash taxes on foreign profits, Cisco Systems Inc. Chief Executive Officer Chuck Robbins said in a phone interview last week: "We do have various scenarios in terms of what we'd do but you can assume we'll focus on the obvious ones -- buy-backs, dividends and M&A activities." Gary Dickerson, CEO of chip equipment maker Applied Materials Inc., said much the same.

We expect Apple would do the same. The amount of cash that Apple has on the sidelines is in the hundreds of billions and it continues to grow, despite Apple servicing its debt and returning plenty of capital to shareholders still. This is a near-to-mid term catalyst that we think could be of potentially huge benefit for Apple shareholders.

Another piece of news that made its way out this week was that Apple was considering heading into original content. We are not going to beat a dead horse and talk again about how important we believe content is going to be to the future, but you can reference any number of our previous Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) articles to get a feel for our take on content. Marketwatch reported last week:

Apple Inc. is planning to build a significant new business in original television shows and movies, according to people familiar with the matter, a move that could make it a bigger player in Hollywood and offset slowing sales of iPhones and iPads. These people said the programming would be available to subscribers of Apple's $10-a-month streaming-music service, which has struggled to catch up to the larger Spotify AB. Apple Music already includes a limited number of documentary-style segments on musicians, but nothing like the premium programming it is now seeking.

Regardless, it seems Apple is going to be getting into content, which is a logical move from the media extension of its business that currently exists. Apple is already selling new content both in music and video, and it certainly has the firepower and brand power to create its own content. What Apple shareholders should look forward to, if this happens, is Apple seeing a perk up in its valuation to get a bit closer to content companies now.

Microsoft, for instance, doesn't offer much content but offers several software as a service options. It has a P/E multiple of almost double what Apple's multiple is. If Apple can start to participate in these types of subscription-based software services (media content or otherwise), we would not be surprised to see its multiple expand accordingly.

Like all good fundamental investments, we think that there is also an opportunity for growth in Apple stock from simply organic growth. It doesn't need to be financial engineering in order for Apple investors to make money. Those investing now may enjoy the benefits of multiple expansion, organic business growth and additional buybacks, all of which we think will easily move Apple closer to the $200 per share mark over the next couple of years.

We believe Apple to be one of the best fundamental investments available and one of the safest places to put your capital in the market right now. We look forward to this new era, where Apple enjoys its operating system finally being the standard and we are excited for the initiatives that the company has in place for the near future. We are long.

Maybe Apple, Inc.'s AirPods Aren't Doing As Well As You Think Last week, e-commerce analytics tracker Slice Intelligence estimated that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was already dominating the market for wireless headphones, thanks to the launch of AirPods in December and supplemented by Beats' existing strong position in the market. Specifically, Slice was estimating that Apple was grabbing an impressive 40% of the wireless headphone market between AirPods and Beats combined. If that sounded too good to be true considering the severe supply constraints that AirPods are currently suffering from -- well, maybe it really was.

Survey says

Market researcher NPD has now released some data that questions Slice's estimates (via CNET). According to NPD's data for December 2016, Apple currently only has 2% unit share of the wireless headphone market, while Beats has 25% unit share. Given Apple's premium pricing for both products and brands, that translates into 3% revenue share for AirPods and 46% revenue share for Beats. Here's how some of the other top players fared for the month, ranked by revenue share.

Company/Brand Unit Share Revenue Share Beats 25% 46% Bose 8% 19% LG 10% 7% Sony 7% 6% Apple 2% 3%

For reference, NPD estimates that a year ago in December 2015, Beats was able to grab 24% unit share and 49% revenue share, comparable performance to this time around; Beats' strong position in the premium headphone space was one key reason why Apple acquired the company. More importantly, Beats was able to maintain its position even as the market has been evolving and shifting toward wireless Bluetooth headphones, so Beats is keeping up with the times.

Why the difference?

That's a pretty drastic discrepancy between Slice's numbers and NPD's numbers for AirPods -- 26% compared to 3% in revenue share, respectively. There are a few possible explanations.

For starters, Slice only looks at online sales and its methodology revolves around analyzing e-receipts that are aggregated from a panel of over 4.4 million online shoppers (the sample sizes for Slice's estimates ranged from about 2,900 shoppers to over 350,000 shoppers). NPD, in contrast, also includes brick-and-mortar sales along with online sales, which should provide a more comprehensive view of the market. While e-commerce has been growing for years, brick-and-mortar retail still comprises a meaningful chunk of the market, so ignoring that part of the market can lead to some faulty conclusions.

Additionally, given Slice's methodology of tracking e-receipts, it's not clear how unfulfilled orders are treated. It's possible that Slice picked up on a surge of online orders following the launch, but AirPods are still suffering from severe supply constraints and new orders don't ship for six weeks. It seems conceivable that a lot of the sales that Slice is tracking may not be filled yet, and only tracking e-receipts could artificially inflate the figures even if many of those customers haven't actually received their products.

Still impressive

Here's the thing: Even if investors go with NPD's far more conservative figures, it's still an impressive debut for AirPods. Keep in mind that AirPods launched in mid-December, and yet despite constraints and only being available for half of the month, they were able to grab 2% unit share and 3% revenue share in a fairly large market. And those numbers only go up from here. Apple Inc. Faces a New Threat to the iPhone 8 (AAPL) Apple inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is all too familiar with Andy Rubin. The creator of Android led the effort to knock iOS off its perch and take a commanding lead in the smartphone platform wars. With a critical iPhone 8 release scheduled for 2017, Rubin is once again poised to be a thorn in AAPL s side with news he is preparing to launch his own Essential smartphone.

Source: Global Playground

If the new AI-powered, flagship smartphone from Rubin s company lives up to the hype, the Samsung (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) Galaxy S8 and the next Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) Pixel Phone may be the least of Apple s worries this year.

Re-Introducing Andy Rubin

A one-time Apple engineer, Andy Rubin quickly became a serious threat to the company s mobile ambitions. In 2003, he co-founded Android. When Alphabet s Google bought the mobile operating system in 2005, he became the Google senior vice president responsible for Android.

Rubin continued in the position until 2013, when he took over Google s robotics division before leaving the company altogether in 2014.

Now, Rubin is back in the spotlight with his own company   Essential   which is focused on artificial intelligence. And it features a flagship smartphone as its product centerpiece.

The Essential Smartphone

Bloomberg was the first to report on Andy Rubin s new company after CES 2017. According to Bloomberg, Rubin is in discussion with mobile carriers, including Sprint Corp (NYSE: S ), about the Essential smartphone.

The device is still in the prototype stage, but sources say Rubin is planning to launch it by the middle of the year, at a $649 price point. That would mean a new flagship smartphone hitting shelves just months before the iPhone 8. It would add to the tough competition of the Galaxy S8, which will be heavily promoted by Samsung, as well as the follow-up version of Google s Pixel Phone.

The Essential smartphone may pose an even bigger threat to the iPhone 8 than these two Android front-runners.

Bloomberg s sources describe a smartphone with a larger display than the iPhone 7 Plus, but a smaller form factor because the Essential smartphone has an edge-to-edge display that lacks bezels. A magnetic connector does double-duty for charging and as a port for hardware accessories, including a spherical 360-degree camera. The screen could be pressure-sensitive, like the iPhone s. And Essential is reportedly working on a ceramic back, which would utilize the same premium material used in AAPL s latest flagship Apple Watch Edition Series 2.

Behind it all, the Essential smartphone would feature advanced AI technology, which would take on Siri.

Is This a Real Threat to the iPhone 8?

On one hand, it s easy to dismiss the Essential smartphone. It s still in the prototype phase, and if its design is finalized, it may ultimately lack some of the features like the ceramic back. There are big unanswered questions, too, including what operating system it will run.

Apple, Inc. Had to Get In Bed With Qualcomm Because of Verizon In the iPhone's early years, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) bought baseband modems from Infineon, which was later acquired by Intel. The original iPhone launched as an AT&T exclusive, and AT&T's 3G network is built on GSM. The Mac maker was still paying licensing fees to Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), as all cellphone makers around the world must, starting in 2007 with the original iPhone.

But things got a lot more complicated in 2011, which is when Apple and Qualcomm really took their relationship to the next level. It's because of Verizon (NYSE:VZ).

It all started because of Big Red

That was the year that Apple finally launched the iPhone on Big Red's network, ending Ma Bell's exclusivity that was costing Verizon subscribers; the iPhone was a powerful exclusive device that compelled many subscribers to switch. From Apple's perspective, Verizon is the largest carrier in the U.S., so of course it wanted access to that subscriber base. Even though Verizon's 3G network uses CDMA, the cellular technology that Qualcomm helped pioneer, and CDMA is less common in other parts of the world, Apple still recognized that it should offer more variants of the iPhone in order to expand its addressable markets worldwide.

It's worth noting here that China, which became the world's largest smartphone market the following year in 2012, also uses CDMA or variants of CDMA for 3G wireless service.

Here's an excerpt from Apple's complaint (emphasis added):

Apple has been indirectly paying Qualcomm licensing fees since 2007, when it released the iPhone. Apple became even more reliant on Qualcomm in 2011 due to Apple's desire to release an iPhone that could connect to CDMA networks, such as Verizon's. For many years, Qualcomm ensured that it was the only possible supplier of CDMA chipsets, and it remains so today for the chipsets used in Apple's flagship iPhone product line. As a monopoly supplier of an essential input, Qualcomm had the power to constrict and disrupt chipset supply, which (coupled with Qualcomm's refusal to enter into industry-standard supply agreements that would have guaranteed supply to Apple, absent unusual or unforeseen circumstances) would have been disastrous to Apple's business.

Considering Qualcomm's dominance in CDMA, both in terms of its patent portfolio as well as baseband chips, Apple had no choice but to get in bed with the mobile chip giant. For years, it seemed as if the pair had a strong and mutually beneficial relationship evidenced by ongoing exclusivity. But what we now know is that behind the scenes, Apple was incredibly unhappy but also contractually obligated to keep quiet. The Mac maker now says that it was continuously forced into "undesirable, one-sided, and unreasonable contract terms."

Ultimately, it was still probably worth it, considering the iPhone's multiyear growth run that only just ended in 2016. That growth was fueled by both tapping the largest U.S. carrier as well as expanding internationally, including in China. Earnings Preview: Can Apple, Inc. Return to Growth? Scheduled to report results for its first fiscal quarter of 2017 on Tuesday, Jan. 31, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will show whether it has returned to revenue growth. With trailing-12-month revenue down 8%, even a small year-over-year increase in Apple's first-quarter revenue would be a nice change.

Here's a preview of the earnings report as well as some background on a few key areas worth checking in on when the tech giant reports results.

The numbers

Metric Q1 2017 Guidance* Q1 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $77 billion $75.9 million 1.4% Earnings per share $3.17 $3.28 (3.4%) Gross profit margin 38.25% 40.1% (185 basis points)

After reporting three quarters straight of year-over-year declines in revenue, Apple expects about a 1.4% year-over-year increase in revenue in its first quarter. But despite expectations for higher revenue, management anticipates a 3.4% earnings decline as its profit margin is negatively impacted by currency headwinds, higher cost structures for new products, and an unfavorable comparison due to a $548 million award from a patent infringement in the year-ago quarter.

3 key areas to watch

Beyond Apple's first-quarter revenue, EPS, and gross profit margin, investors should look at iPhone sales, guidance for Apple's second quarter, and services revenue growth.

1. iPhone sales: Accounting for 63% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, the iPhone segment is undoubtedly the company's most important business. The segment dwarfs its other segments, which represent 11% or less of trailing-12-month sales.

So, what can investors expect from iPhone sales? Given Apple's guidance for its overall results and the influence of the iPhone segment on total results, investors should expect similar iPhone revenue and unit sales this year since Apple is only guiding for a 1.4% increase in total revenue. In the year-ago quarter, iPhone revenue was $51.6 billion and iPhone unit sales were 74.8 million.

2. Guidance: One of the quarter's most insightful metrics will be the guidance Apple provides for its second quarter. With this figure, investors will get to see whether management expects more revenue growth.

Given that the iPhone 7 didn't stick to Apple's usual biannual schedule for form factor overhauls, it's possible the company could return to year-over-year declines in the second quarter. But until it provides guidance, there isn't any clear indication of what investors should expect for the trajectory of revenue beyond its first quarter.

3. Services revenue growth: One segment that could help drive surprising growth is the services segment, which includes sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services. In the most recent quarter, services revenue was up an impressive 24%, hitting a record $6.3 billion. Growing to 13% of Apple's revenue in the quarter, services is now its second-largest segment. If the segment benefited from a significant holiday boost in the first quarter, the growing segment may play a key role in helping Apple's overall revenue this year -- possibly even serving as the key factor for preventing further declines in total revenue.

In its most recent quarter, year-over-year services revenue growth accelerated from 19% in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to 24% in its fourth quarter. Look to see if Apple can maintain this higher growth rate achieved in its fourth quarter.

In addition to the first-quarter report after market close on Jan. 31, management will host a live conference call to discuss results at 2:00 p.m. PST. Apple: Can Services Save The Day?  Apple Inc.: a pre-mortem Last year marked the fifth year of Tim Cook s reign, and year 3 of "Tim Cook's Apple". With recent technological shifts, Apple is at a crossroads of sorts; therefore, I believe a pre-mortem is expedient.

This is a great article.

I, too, wonder if Apple is so stuck on "let's just slap apps on it" that it serves to detriment their efforts. Virtually all their product introductions lately centred around slapping apps on existing, boring hardware and hope for the best. I'm not sure if the linked article's suggestions are the right way to go, but I do know that Apple places more faith in apps than is really warranted.

A cold and harsh truth Apple doesn't seem to grasp: nobody cares about apps. Apps are done. People have a small set of apps they use every day, usually the big name apps such as Facebook and Twitter, and really - that's it. Aside from us nerdier people, nobody browses through the App Store or Google Play, filled with anticipation for what they might find. If you really break it down, I'm pretty sure most people use maybe 2-3 apps daily, and any others maybe once per month.

That's really not something you want to bank your product strategy on. Apple: No Safety, No Value

Report: Apple Inc.'s Revolutionary OLED iPhone Will Have a Flat Display A market research analyst with IHS Markit told MacRumors that Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming premium iPhone -- which is widely expected to usher in an all-new industrial design with an OLED display -- will not use a curved OLED display. Instead, it will use a "flat" OLED display that the analyst says will be "analogous to the current 2.5D glass design."

The IHS Markit analyst isn't the first credible source to claim that Apple's OLED iPhone will have a flat OLED display; MacRumors points out that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo as well as TrendForce -- both credible sources with good track records -- had previously reported that the OLED iPhone would use "2.5D cover glass."

What does this news mean for Apple's business and, ultimately, investors? Here's my take.

Curved or not, this is a big jump

The OLED iPhone, whether it has a curved display or not, is likely going to be a real improvement in form factor and aesthetics compared with the current-generation models. The OLED display itself should enable much improved image quality (if Apple can make this display HDR-capable, then that'd be an even bigger bonus), and the form factor is said to include a stainless-steel frame as well as a higher screen-to-body ratio than the current iPhone models do.

The display and form factor changes, coupled with what are sure to be solid improvements in camera capabilities, internal specifications, and even the rumored 3D sensing capabilities, are probably going to be enough to trigger a so-called iPhone "super cycle" -- at least if such a cycle can still occur these days.

If Apple can ship the devices with a curved OLED display, that'd be nice, but this is unlikely to make or break the commercial success of the device.

Saving curved displays for next time?

Interestingly, a report from The Bell (via MacRumors) claims that Apple aims to switch over completely to OLED-based displays for its iPhone product line by 2019.

I suspect that once Apple introduces this rumored premium iPhone in its product stack, it is going to want to continue to have products at that price point in future generations even as technologies originally introduced at that premium price point trickle down into the more mainstream models.

What Apple could do, then, is "save" the curved display for the premium iPhone that it introduces next year, while transitioning its mainstream iPhone products to flat OLED displays. That way, Apple improves the appeal of its products across its product stack while keeping the best technological goodies in the most expensive products.

An exciting product cycle ahead for Apple

The main point is this: Apple appears to have an exciting product cycle ahead of it as it introduces the premium OLED iPhone alongside what are expected to be refreshed versions of the current iPhone 7/7 Plus designs.

What remains an open question, though, is how Apple intends to maintain/grow iPhone demand following the potentially upcoming "super cycle."

Apple may be able to further stimulate demand by bringing flat OLED displays to the "standard" price points while introducing 3D curved displays in the next-generation premium model, but without a significant delta in features/functionality between the "premium" model and the "standard" models, Apple might risk seeing a mix down in its product shipments in the following cycle.

That said, I have some thoughts on how Apple can counter that -- but that's a topic that I'm saving for my next Apple-related column. Stay tuned. Apple Inc. Building Graphics Chip Team in the UK It's no secret at this point that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is building its own graphics processors. In fact, not only that, but microprocessor expert David Kanter revealed last year that Apple has been employing its own graphics processors inside its A-series processors since the launch of its A8 system-on-a-chip in the fall of 2014.

Based on where many of the graphics-oriented Apple employees that I see on LinkedIn appear to be located, the company apparently has a graphics processor design site in Orlando, Florida.

While perusing LinkedIn, I noticed that one of my connections began advertising the fact that Apple is looking to fill positions in its U.K.-based "Apple Hardware Design Center."

Unsurprisingly, as you can see in the screenshot below, all the positions that came up were graphics related:

Further, when I clicked on one of the positions ("Graphics Modeling Engineer"), the job description says "This is a career defining opportunity to get in at the ground floor as we build our UK Design Centre."

It's clear that the company is building a graphics processor design team in the U.K. So, why is the company doing that?

Increasing the pace of innovation

What I suspect Apple is doing is building a parallel graphics processor team to the one(s) that it already has in place. If that hypothesis is correct, it'll mean that the company will gain the ability to work on multiple graphics processors in a "leap frogging" fashion.

That is, Team 1 works on the graphics processor that'll be used in some iPhone (let's call it iPhone x) while Team 2 works in parallel on the graphics processor that will be used in the follow-on iPhone, iPhone x+1. Then, once Team 1 finishes its work on the graphics processor for iPhone x, it begins working on the graphics processor for iPhone x+2.

Under such a development methodology -- and it is a common one in the chip industry -- a company can increase the pace and the scope of the innovation that it can bring with each new design.

Why is Apple doubling-down on graphics?

Apple CEO Tim Cook is on record stating that he believes that augmented reality will be a huge deal. To fully capitalize on the opportunities in both virtual reality and augmented reality, companies are likely going to need to have significant expertise when it comes to efficient, high-performance graphics processors.

In other words, it's an intellectual property that could be very important for the future of the iPhone and mobile devices in general.

Beyond the iPhone, though, Apple surely wants to have best-in-class graphics to enable the kinds of workloads and experiences that it can deliver through its iPad (which it is positioning as a notebook/PC replacement) as well as through its Apple TV products (better graphics could help Apple TV inch closer to becoming a game console competitor).

Apple appears to recognize the importance of having excellent graphics technologies in-house and I think what we are seeing is Apple simply making financial bets commensurate with that viewpoint. How Will a Supplier's Factory Fire Affect Apple Inc.? According to analysts with research firm BlueFin Research Partners (by way of Barron's), a "small fire" broke out in the basement of the clean room in ST Microelectronics' manufacturing plant, commonly referred to in the chip industry as a fab, short for "fabrication plant," in Crolles, France.

"This fab is the sole manufacturing facility for 3D sensors" at ST Microelectronics, the analysts explain, adding that this "incident has currently shut down the facility" and that their research "indicates [that] it could take several weeks to requalify the fab and resume production."

Why is this news? Because it's believed that ST Microelectronics (NYSE:STM) will be providing 3D image sensors to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for its upcoming premium iPhone.

To make matters worse, the analysts say these 3D sensors have a "long production cycle time" and "relatively low yield rate." BlueFin says these factors "will make it difficult to get back on their production schedule target with each day that the fab is incapacitated."

Let's go over what the implications to Apple's upcoming premium iPhone could be.

Understanding the problem

It's important to understand that in the chip industry, it takes a long time to go from a blank silicon wafer to a fully processed one with usable chips on it. The time it takes for the wafer to go through the manufacturing process is called the "cycle time."

Cycle time is typically about three months, give or take, depending on several factors. According to BlueFin, ST Micro's 3D sensors have a "long production cycle time," so it might take more like four months for these 3D sensors to be manufactured.

If the fab is taken offline for a significant amount of time, that pushes out the entire chip production schedule. What this ultimately could mean, then, is that Apple won't be able to build as many iPhones as it had originally planned to ahead of the launch.

What is Apple to do?

The BlueFin analysts say they "believe it is likely that [Apple] and [ST Micro] are assessing the impact to the schedule and are working on a recovery plan." Additionally, they say they "have yet to see any corresponding push out of the iPhone 8/X builds with the rest of the supply chain."

To be blunt, I could see Apple simply going along with its product launches as expected and simply having customers order the phones, even if it means that those customers must wait several weeks for their devices to come in.

You may recall that Apple faced manufacturing yield issues on its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus devices in jet black. It took a while before everyone's orders were fulfilled, but people got their orders in, they waited, and they eventually got them.

And, of course, Apple reached supply/demand balance for all its iPhone models by January.

Don't panic

Designing and building innovative devices with a whole host of new and possibly difficult-to-manufacture components isn't easy, and companies that try to stay at the forefront of device innovation are necessarily going to face challenges in bringing new products to market.

That's just the reality of the situation, and investors need to get comfortable with that.

The fire at ST Micro's fab is unfortunate, and it's a headache that both Apple and ST Micro could have gone without, but I have confidence that the experienced professionals at both companies will do their best to contain the situation and launch the new iPhones as soon as practicable.

Is Apple, Inc. About to Kill Touch ID? Touch ID has been an unqualified success. By integrating biometric security into iPhones, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) raised the bar in terms of what consumers expect of their smartphones, and rivals expectedly followed suit by implementing their own fingerprint sensors shortly thereafter. But there's been some speculation for years that Apple is interested in removing the home button on future iPhones, which just so happens to be where the Touch ID sensor is integrated. Meanwhile, it may adopt some sort of 3D facial recognition or iris scanning technology to bolster the iPhone's biometric security.

Would Apple really kill Touch ID altogether?

Rumor has it

That's the theory that JPMorgan analyst Rod Hall is putting forth (via MacRumors). Hall believes that Apple will finally pull the trigger on killing the home button with the iPhone 8, Apple's 10th-generation iPhone due out later this year. This would allow the company to implement an edge-to-edge display. Apple is reportedly looking to include a 3D laser scanner that would allow for facial recognition, a component that runs around $10 to $15.

Hall notes that Touch ID sometimes fails, like in wet conditions. iPhones have been getting progressively more waterproof, so using Touch ID under wet conditions is more common nowadays. Facial recognition could work more seamlessly, and could even be used for Apple Pay authentication. It's also worth pointing out that since facial recognition is very software-intensive, the performance would likely be able to improve over time via software updates as the recognition algorithms improve over time. It's even possible that the laser scanner could be used for augmented reality applications, something CEO Tim Cook has been discussing at length in recent months, which could similarly be added later on via a software update.

Third-party developers might eventually even get access to a 3D scanning application programming interface (API), which has the potential to unleash a wave of innovation.

Will Touch ID join the headphone jack?

If you recall, Touch ID was based on Apple's 2012 acquisition of AuthenTec for $356 million, which itself was a clear signal that Apple was planning on integrating fingerprint sensors. Touch ID would debut the following year in 2013's iPhone 5S, and subsequently made its way throughout the iPhone portfolio. While it would be a shame to shutter Touch ID, Apple has sold 690 million total iPhones and generated nearly $450 billion in iPhone revenue since the iPhone 5S launch, so it certainly got its money worth from the acquisition since Touch ID has been a key feature that contributed to sales growth ever since.

What's more peculiar, however, is the fact that Apple only recently brought Touch ID to the Mac in last year's MacBook Pros with Touch Bar. This was widely seen as a starting point, and Apple is expected to subsequently bring Touch ID to the rest of the Mac lineup. Apple is already testing out stand-alone keyboards with Touch ID for Mac desktops, according to a Bloomberg report from December.

Instead of killing Touch ID, Apple should just supplement it with facial recognition instead of replacing it since Touch ID has become an integral part of how users interact with their devices. Until Apple's fall event, which will probably be in September as usual, we won't know if Touch ID will suffer the same fate as the headphone jack.

Apple, Inc. CEO Tim Cook Talks Up Augmented Reality's Potential (Again) Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has emerged as the next champion of augmented reality (AR). Despite the company's penchant for secrecy, it's become increasingly clear that Apple has something in the pipeline given that CEO Tim Cook keeps talking about AR's transformative potential. This is that whole "ship leaking from the top" bit that Steve Jobs always referred to.

Every few months, Cook weighs in on the debate, either when asked on an earnings conference call or during a media interview. While Cook has never been a product visionary type, even by his own admission, his rationale for why AR has more potential than virtual reality (VR) makes an awful lot of sense, given Apple's never-ending pursuit of technologies that have mainstream appeal.

The most recent interview is with The Independent, which was published earlier today. Among other topics, Cook discussed why AR is the way to go.

"AR allows individuals to be present in the world"

Perhaps the most off-putting aspect of VR for the average consumer is the fact that users must don a headset to fully immerse themselves into a virtual world. Even before discussing the technical requirements or costs associated with a VR headset, it's fundamentally isolating. In contrast, AR sits on top of the real world as an overlay without the isolation.

I'm excited about Augmented Reality because unlike Virtual Reality which closes the world out, AR allows individuals to be present in the world but hopefully allows an improvement on what's happening presently. Most people don't want to lock themselves out from the world for a long period of time and today you can't do that because you get sick from it. With AR you can, not be engrossed in something, but have it be a part of your world, of your conversation. That has resonance.

Cook continued that he sees the opportunity in AR as analogous to the smartphone, believing that it can be for "everyone." AR still isn't there quite yet, and needs to improve until its "good enough for the mainstream," according to the chief executive.

How and when?

Cook's comments are but the latest in the ongoing debate over AR's future. In 2016, Cook discussed AR three consecutive months in a row: The Washington Post in August, ABC News in September, and BuzzFeed News in October. It's obviously been on his mind quite a bit.

At this point, the two most important questions are how Apple will implement it -- a separate AR headset or integrated into the iPhone camera system, or both -- and when Apple will officially release its AR offering. If Apple goes the route of first integrating AR into the iPhone, which would largely be software-based, it could reduce the likelihood of leaks. In contrast, if Apple wants to jump straight to an AR headset, its supply chain will inevitably leak as prototypes are manufactured and there will be more physical evidence of its aspirations.

Hopefully sooner rather than later, Apple will unveil its next "big idea."

Report: Apple Inc. Supplier to Start Building A11 Chip in April Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM), or TSMC for short, has manufactured Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) A-series applications processors, which power the company's iPhone and iPad products, for several years now.

Apple first started having TSMC build its applications processors beginning with the A8 system-on-a-chip found inside of the iPhone 6-series devices, and that relationship has continued with the A9, A9X, and A10 processors.

Per Economic Daily News (by way of DIGITIMES), TSMC is expected to start cranking out Apple's next-generation A-series processor -- which is likely to be branded the A11 Fusion -- in April.

Additionally, the report goes on to say that TSMC will "prepare a capacity for production of 50 million units of the chip before July."

By the end of the year, the report says, TSMC is "expected to maintain a capacity for rolling out 100 million A11 chips before the end of 2017."

In other words, all seems to be going to plan.

TSMC to gain unit share at Apple this year

It is widely believed that the Apple will sole-source the A11 Fusion from TSMC this year, just as it relied exclusively on TSMC to build the current-generation A10 Fusion chips.

If that ultimately turns out to be the case -- and at this point, I don't see why it wouldn't be -- then TSMC stands to gain share at Apple this year.

Remember that, today, Apple is selling the iPhone 7 series, iPhone 6s series, and iPhone SE smartphones. The iPhone 7 is powered by the A10 Fusion, built exclusively by TSMC, while the iPhone 6s and SE devices are powered by Apple's A9 chip -- a chip that was dual-sourced between TSMC and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) (with Samsung believed to have the majority allocation).

This means that there's still a fair amount of A-series volume that TSMC doesn't have today.

The good news for TSMC, though, is that when the iPhone 7 series waterfalls down to serve as the company's midrange products, a significant amount of Apple's chip volume should transition from Samsung to TSMC.

All that will be left for TSMC to try to achieve sole-source status on -- at least, on the iPhone side of things -- will be the spot inside of the entry-level iPhone SE.

It's not clear when Apple intends to update the internals of the SE, but I expect that when it does so, it will get an A10 or an A11 -- either one would be a win for TSMC.

More than just units

Not only does TSMC stand to gain unit share at Apple this year, but it should see a sizable increase in silicon content per smartphone. The A11 Fusion is going to be built on TSMC's leading-edge 10-nanometer technology and it is likely that Apple has opted to make the chip relatively large (my bet is on a chip area greater than 100 square millimeters) to dramatically increase the functionality over the A10 Fusion.

Those leading-edge 10-nanometer wafers, and ultimately chips, should be relatively pricey, which could help boost TSMC's revenue per iPhone on an apples-to-apples basis.

Additionally, the A10 Fusion is significantly larger than the A9 chip was (the TSMC-built A9 measures in at 104.5 square millimeters per Chipworks; the A10 Fusion at 125 square millimeters).

So, not only should Apple benefit by taking unit share from Samsung in the midrange iPhone models, but the direct replacements for the TSMC-built A9 chips should be larger chips. That means TSMC will be able to sell Apple a greater number of silicon wafers to support the same level of midrange smartphone volume shipments.

A nice cycle for TSMC

With respect to Apple, things are looking good for TSMC. It stands to increase the amount of silicon content that it provides per iPhone as well as gain unit share within the iPhone family. Even if Apple's unit volumes don't grow much in the coming product cycle (which, frankly, seems unlikely -- I expect them to grow), TSMC should be in a good position to increase its Apple-related revenue this year. Apple: Panic Time, Again? We've all heard that the only two guaranteed things in life are death and taxes. We'll, there's a third thing that I might be adding to that list, a thing I call "panic time" which occurs in the month before earnings from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). It seems like analysts always want to get cautious before the tech giant reports its quarter, and Monday's headlines seem like the start of this process again.

There were two major analysts' notes this morning that reinforce this notion. The first came from Susquehanna, which noted that meetings in Asia last week suggest Apple is only planning to build and ship about 100 million iPhone units in the second half of this year, down from a previous expectation of 110 to 115 million. This might suggest that certain new components for the iPhone 8 are not ready in high enough volumes, kind of like how we saw long waits for the iPhone 7 Plus due to low supply of the dual lens camera.

The other note came from FBN, and it was one of those "two-sided" notes that's both positive and negative, giving the analyst(s) room to be right no matter which way the stock and/or company go. The firm reiterated an Outperform rating and $155 target, but it also listed several concerns:

Significant share loss in China.

Challenges in penetrating Indian market.

Declining gross margins for iPhone.

A mature and slowing smartphone market.

For those that have followed my coverage of Apple, you know that I've detailed this scenario several times before. Just a few months ago in January, I talked about a negative Nikkei report regarding iPhone production, which was then followed by multiple analyst estimate cuts. A year ago, we saw a similar process with estimates coming down into the April report after Apple launched the iPhone SE amid concerns of an iPhone 6s slowdown. Just in the past three or four years, I've seen at least half a dozen instances of this Street panic in the weeks leading up to earnings.

Obviously, this year's iPhone launch is a major catalyst for the stock, one reason why investors have been sending shares to new all-time highs recently. However, we're still more than five months away from the launch of the device, and that's plenty of time for other news and rumors to come out. The next iPhone does need to be a hit, as expectations are that Apple will set a new fiscal year revenue record approaching $250 billion in fiscal 2018.

In the short term, investors should really be focusing on US tax news, especially after the Trump administration's failure regarding healthcare reform. Since the new President took over, Apple investors have been hoping for lower tax rates and a repatriation holiday allowing the company to bring back billions of dollars to the US. If we don't see any positive news on taxes in the coming weeks, investors may be disappointed with this year's potential dividend raise and buyback increase, and that could hurt the stock.

In the end, investors should not be surprised if the Apple "panic time" scenario plays out again. Analysts like to be very cautious about this name going into earnings, and that feeling might be even more this year without any positive tax news. The Street is currently expecting almost 8% revenue growth for the June quarter, so it seems there is some room for guidance to disappoint or analysts to lower estimates after the so-so iPad refresh and no major update of the iPhone SE. Just like we saw last quarter, if Street worries send the stock a bit lower in the coming weeks, long-term investors might appreciate the chance at a better entry point.

Wins Patent Ruling In China Over iPhone Design Apple s relationship with China   one of the largest smartphone markets in the world   has been rocky for the past several months due to several issues, but a recent ruling by the Beijing Court removes one of the issues.

Some relief for Apple in China

An IP court in Beijing has overturned a May 2016 ruling which claimed the iPhone maker violated design patents held by a small, no-longer-functioning Chinese company called Shenzhen Baili.

For the world s biggest brand, this small court ruling is pretty important, as it is no longer considered guilty of copying a design patent for the iPhone 6. According to the verdict reported by the state judicial daily RenminFayuanRibao, the Beijing Court has reversed the Beijing Intellectual Property Office s decision and recognized that the tech giant has not  infringed the design patent filed by the company Shenzhen Baili. 

The court ruled that the iPhone 6 had features which  completely change the effect of the entire product   and both phones are easily distinguishable in the eyes of consumers. 

What was the case about?

The smartphone maker has long been trying to attract customers in China and has received mixed results so far. iPhones are quite popular in China, but the tech giant has not been doing great due to rising competition from domestic smartphone makers like Huawei, Oppo, Vivo, etc. The U.S. firm is facing difficulties not just from rivals but also from patent-holding entities and government agencies.

The Beijing Intellectual Property Office supported plaintiff Shenzen Baili last year in the 2014 case it filed against the Cupertino-based company for patent infringement. The defunct company claimed that the new design of the iPhone 6 infringed on the design of its own 100C smartphone with its curved edges and rounded corners. The dispute was over the exterior design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

Apple was granted a stay on the injunction, pending an appeal, helping it continue sales of the iPhone in the country. Shenzhen Baili s legal team plans to appeal the ruling.

This is not the first time the iPhone maker has been sued by a Chinese company for allegedly copying patents. There are several other cases against the U.S. firm, including the iPhone trademark and a patent infringement case pertaining to Siri. As of now, there have been comments on the matter from the U.S. firm. Apple Inc. Sees Record Apple Music Streaming Numbers For New Drake Album AAPL   Apple boasts that Beats 1 is the  biggest radio station in the world. .

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) saw a record amount of streams on its Apple Music service for record artist Drake s new album, More Life, Republic Records exec Jimmy Iovine said in a recent interview.

Iovine told The Verge that the combination of Apple s Beats 1 radio network and OVO Sound Radio actually allowed Apple Music to beat Spotify in terms of streaming numbers, despite a much smaller user base:

For Drake, Beats 1 has essentially replaced SoundCloud, the platform he once dominated and released singles through   a move that Apple Music s head of content Larry Jackson and Apple VP of apps and content Robert Kondrk said was a risk for Drake at the time.  We weren t a proven hit, we weren t a proven entity at all, whatsoever,  says Jackson. SoundCloud just got a shoutout from Chance The Rapper at the Grammys, but the service has been having a rough time since Drake left, with Recode reporting it recently had to raise a $70 million debt round just to stay afloat.

Apple Music s head of content Larry Jackson boasted recently that  It s the biggest radio station in the world. There s no way you re going to find another station that has as many concurrent listeners and audience-wise as Beats 1, period.  Apple won t provide specific numbers to back up its claims, however.

Regardless, as Apple Music and Beats 1 continue to make major inroads with audiences, Apple appears to have two new streaming music hit services on its hands. And that can only be good news for shareholders and fans of the company.

Apple Inc. shares fell $0.94 (-0.67%) in premarket trading Monday. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 21.96%, versus a 4.62% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

AAPL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 28 stocks in the Technology   Hardware category. Apple Releases 2016 Supplier Responsibility Report Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has just released its eleventh annual Supplier Responsibility Report, and the company reported progress in several areas, including UL Zero Waste to Landfill validation, use of conflict minerals, and others. The iPhone maker s suppliers also reported progress in working conditions. It audited 705 suppliers for its 2016 report.

Millions of workers trained on their right

According to Apple Inc. (AAPL), it found 98% compliance with the 60-hour cap on work weeks, which it said was the highest ever. The company trained more than 2.4 million workers on their rights as employees last year as well, and more than 2 million people have taken part in its Supplier Education Program since 2008.

The company also tripled the number of sites that participated in its Energy Efficiency program, which reduced more than 150,000 metric tons of carbon emissions. Last year also marked the first year that all of the final assembly sites for Apple Inc. (AAPL) products in China achieved 100% UL Zero Waste to Landfill validation. The company s Clean Water program has also saved more than 3.8 billion gallons of fresh water since 2013.

Apple makes progress on conflict minerals

Another key area of improvement for Apple Inc. (AAPL) s suppliers last year was sourcing for conflict minerals, an issue which has especially come under the microscope since Donald Trump took office. Last year was the first year the iPhone maker s responsible sourcing efforts added cobalt. The company also said that 2016 was the second consecutive year that all of its tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold smelters and refiners agreed to third-party audits.

The Trump administration may seek to suspend laws that require disclosure of the use of conflict minerals in products, which would mean that Apple Inc. (AAPL) would no longer be required to report on this. Conflict minerals are those that are usually mined in war-torn regions like the Congo, where such mining often funds violence.

However, the iPhone maker s Supplier Responsibility Report is aimed at painting it in a positive light in terms of its sourcing and treatment of its workers, particularly those at factories in China that have been heavily criticized in previous years due to poor working conditions. As a result, Apple Inc. (AAPL) may choose to continue providing disclosures about its conflict mineral sourcing. In fact, a spokesperson for the company told BuzzFeed that  notwithstanding an changes to regulations  or deregulation,  they intend to keep running the same audit and accountability programs.

Apple Inc. (AAPL) also said it partnered with many non-governmental organizations to push for more changes in conflict mineral sourcing, including Pact, which is pushing for proper health and safety training for artisanal mining. A Glimpse into Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (AMD) Zen Revival, Apple Inc.'s ... Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have secured strong momentum on their side, between AMD re-entering the chip-maker ball game with new Zen resurgence and Apple s long-term edge into augmented reality with Apple Pay. One of Wall Street s best-performing analysts highlights even greater confidence in AMD s chances to outclass consensus expectations while Apple expert Gene Munster sees Apple leading the AR revolution. Let s take a closer look:

AMD is the Comeback Kid

Top analyst Mark Lipacis at Jefferies is seeing some boomerang potential for AMD after assessing the Asia PC supply chain, spotlighting a positive shift happening at the chip giant s headquarters. In reaction, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AMD with a $16 price target, which represents a just under 19% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

Lipacis asserts,  Our recent checks in the Asia PC supply chain support our thesis of a systemic turnaround at AMD, namely: 1) higher responsiveness and better execution, 2) enthusiasm for Zen Desktop MPUs, 3) positive expectations for Zen Server. The supply chain is in  wait and see  mode for Notebook Zen. The checks give us higher conviction in our above consensus estimates. 

Diving more in depth,  Our recent checks in the Asia supply chain indicate an important change in process and execution from AMD since its new CEO, Lisa Su, took over 2.5 years ago. Anecdotes indicate that not only has AMD become more responsive to PCODM questions and issues, but also that these are being dealt with at much higher levels of AMD s organization. There also appears to be a higher level of trust in AMD s ability to execute,  continues the analyst.

On a final bullish note,  We continue to hear a high level of enthusiasm for AMD s new Zen Desktop MPU, the recent firmware issues (which we view as temporary) notwithstanding,  Lipacis concludes.

Looking ahead, the analyst anticipates a Zen-Notebook launch in the back half of the year, with the supply chain eagerly looking for samples to come to light.

Mark Lipacis has a very good TipRanks score with a 78% success rate and a high ranking of #3 out of 4,554 analysts. Lipacis yields 29.5% in his annual returns. When recommending AMD, Lipacis gains 63.3% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics demonstrate AMD as a Buy. Out of 19 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 9 are bullish on AMD stock, 9 remain sidelined, and 1 is bearish on the stock. With a loss potential of 14%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $11.75.

Apple Preparing to Make its Mark on AR through Apple Pay

In a world where augmented reality is evolving leaps and bounds to the forefront of technology, how does Apple weigh into the equation? From the eyes of Gene Munster   contributing insights from his new research-driven, venture capital firm Loup Ventures   the tech giant is riding the Apple Pay adoption trend from October of last year through the next decade.

Munster predicts,  Over the next 5-10 years, we believe augmented reality will emerge as the next dominant computing paradigm and that Google and Apple will provide the operating systems that power AR computing. 

When assessing Apple Pay adoption metrics, the analyst took a gander at internet retailer online sites to determine where the feature s popularity stands. So far, the feature has earned 9% desktop browser adoption, 13% mobile browser adoption, and 40% in-app adoption. For the analyst, these rates are escalating well and can stand to compete with rivals Alphabet and Samsung wallet.

 In other words, the company has had over 2 years to build adoption at point of sale. Apple Pay at point of sale works with a broader tap and pay network; most locations that accept Apple Pay also accept other tap and pay offerings including Google Wallet and Samsung Pay. Since this our first measurement, we don t have a comparative number. Bottom line: adoption of Apple Pay at point of sale is growing nicely, in-line with growth among other digital payment players, including Google and Samsung wallet,  explains the analyst.

As far as the user experience is concerned regarding easy-to-use satisfaction,  Bottom line: Apple Pay enjoys slightly better placement on mobile vs desktop,  Munster contends.

TipRanks analytics exhibit AAPL as a Buy. Based on 36 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 28 rate a Buy on Apple stock, 6 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. The 12-month average price target stands at $153.00, marking a nearly 9% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

Apple, Inc. iPhone Sales in China Reportedly Fell 18% Last Year China has been the world's largest smartphone market for a few years now, underscoring how important the region is for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). But the Mac maker has hit a speed bump in the Middle Kingdom in recent quarters, largely thanks to intensifying competition from local, low-cost manufacturers. The company occasionally mentions growth rates for various geographical markets, but it doesn't disclose unit sales by region in detail. That leaves investors having to rely on third-party estimates, and the most recent ones don't look good.

We're No. 5! We're No. 5!

Market researcher Canalys released its estimates today for the Chinese smartphone market in 2016. Total unit volumes in China hit a fresh high of 476.5 million handsets, up 11%. Of that total, roughly 131.6 million units were shipped in the fourth quarter, a quarterly record that represents a third of the global market. The top four brands were all Chinese manufacturers; Apple came in at No. 5 amid declining unit volumes.

Manufacturer 2016 Units Huawei 76.2 million Oppo 73.2 million Vivo 63.2 million Xiaomi 51.4 million Apple 43.8 million

Both Xiaomi and Apple saw double-digit declines from 2015 levels, with Xiaomi's units falling 21% and Apple's units down 18%. Oppo and Vivo exploded onto the scene in 2016; both companies sold fewer than 40 million units in 2015. Huawei strengthened its position in the tier-one and tier-two cities, according to Canalys analyst Jessie Ding. Oppo and Vivo are now looking to target those regions, while Huawei moves in on tier-three and tier-four cities.

While Apple has never aspired to be the largest vendor in any market by volumes, instead focusing on other things like customer satisfaction and profitability, that's still a discouraging directional trend at a time when Apple has been trying to reinvigorate investor confidence. The iPhone maker's decline in China is also significantly worse than its worldwide volumes; iPhone units fell 7% in 2016 to 215.4 million. If we look at it in absolute units, Canalys' numbers suggest that Apple sold 9.7 million less units in China in 2016, which is a large proportion of the 16.1 million unit decline in total iPhone units. China is becoming an increasingly tough market, and it's weighing on results.

"A very, very difficult market"

Last quarter, Greater China was the only geographical segment of Apple's five reportable segments that did not hit record levels.

Apple's Greater China segment includes Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan. The weakness appears to be coming from Hong Kong and Taiwan, and revenue in mainland China was roughly flat with the record levels from a year ago. Here's CEO Tim Cook on the call:

If you look at how we did in the quarter, as I think Luca shared, our Greater China revenue was down 12% and about 4 points of that was currency related. So it's an 8-point decline in constant currency. And then within Greater China if you look at the [People's Republic of China], our revenue was flat year over year, and that was against the all-time record quarter.

Cook also conceded that Hong Kong "remains a very, very difficult market." Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. IBM Shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) have performed well over the past year, both up about 40% following periods of underperformance. Apple, after reporting three consecutive quarters of sales declines, finally broke out of its funk last month when it reported solid, albeit muddled, holiday quarter results. IBM, after years of earnings declines, expects to return to growth on a per-share basis this year.

Both stocks are cheap relative to earnings, but I think IBM is the better buy. Here's why.

Apple is cheap, but growth will be tough

Shares of Apple trade around their all-time high following the company's fiscal first-quarter report, but the stock is still cheap relative to earnings. Apple produced $45.2 billion of net income over the past 12 months, or $8.39 per share. With a stock price around $131, that puts Apple's PE ratio at roughly 15.6.

But this calculation ignores the immense amount of cash on Apple's balance sheet. At the end of the first quarter, Apple had $246 billion of cash and investments and $77 billion of debt, leaving a net cash position of $169 billion. Valued fully and backed out, Apple's cash-adjusted PE ratio falls to just 11.5.

Apple stock isn't nearly as cheap as it was a year ago, but the market is still pricing in minimal future growth even at all-time highs. There are good reasons for this. Apple remains highly dependent on the iPhone, which accounted for nearly 70% of revenue during the first quarter. With the smartphone market no longer growing quickly, consumers taking longer to upgrade, and mid-range devices getting better and cheaper, consistent iPhone growth going forward is going to be tough to achieve.

And even though Apple managed to grow iPhone sales and EPS during the first quarter, net income declined due to a lower gross margin and higher operating expenses. Share buybacks were the sole source of per-share earnings growth.

Apple is going to need to come up with something big in order to grow earnings meaningfully in the coming years, but it's unclear whether Apple will be able to come up with the next big thing. Services revenue has been growing quickly for Apple, but the jury is still out on whether this will be enough to drive earnings higher.

IBM's transformation makes progress

IBM stock is also cheap, despite the rally over the past year. The company produced $13.59 in adjusted EPS during 2016, putting the P/E ratio at 13. IBM's earnings have been in decline for a few years, and its revenue has been slumping since 2012. But its multiyear transformation is making progress, and the company expects to produce at least $13.80 in adjusted EPS this year.

IBM has been divesting and shifting resources away from shrinking legacy businesses, pouring money into growth initiatives like cloud computing. This shift, while painful, is now starting to bear fruit. IBM's strategic imperatives -- what the company calls its various growth businesses -- now account for 41% of total revenue after growing by 13% in 2016.

The cloud-computing business is booming. Total cloud revenue reached $13.7 billion in 2016, up 35%. Cloud delivered as a service, which includes only infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software as a service, is at an annual revenue run rate of $8.6 billion, up 61% year over year. IBM's ongoing shift to subscription software has hurt overall software sales in the past couple of years, but the software business has now posted growth for three straight quarters.

IBM's earnings have room to grow simply because the bottom line has been beaten down so much over the past few years. As IBM continues to remake itself as a cloud and cognitive computing company, a return to consistent earnings growth is a real possibility.

IBM is the better bet

While I don't necessarily think that Apple is a bad investment, I find it difficult to believe that the company will be able to grow earnings from here. The iPhone is going to have to hold up in a world where good phones are getting cheaper, and the company is going to have to come up with something new and innovative that can move the needle.

IBM, on the other hand, has a much broader business, with a vast customer base dependent on its products and services. Earnings have room to grow substantially as the strategic imperatives, which are more software-heavy than the company as a whole, continue to expand. Given similar valuations, I'll take IBM any day. Apple, Inc.'s Stock's 40% Comeback -- What Investors Should Know Over the past 12 months, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has absolutely trounced the S&P 500, surging 40.4%, from just under $95 per share to about $132 at the time of this writing. This rise compares with the S&P 500's 22% gain during the same period. Interestingly, the performance of Apple's business during this period hasn't been particularly impressive. So, what drove the stock higher?

Boring results

In Apple's most recently reported trailing-12-month period, results actually look quite dismal. During this period, revenue fell 7% and earnings per share tumbled an even steeper 11.3%. Yet Apple stock surged higher.

Sure, Apple's financial results have turned upward recently, with the tech giant reporting 3.3% and 9.6% year-over-year increases in revenue and EPS for the company's most recently reported quarter. But this is just one quarter. Further, these aren't the sort of results often associated with 40% rises in a stock price -- especially when referring to a popular tech company.

But despite Apple's lackluster performance in the past 12 months, shares have climbed higher and easily outperformed the market.

Valuation matters

So if Apple's business saw both revenue and EPS decline in the past 12 reported months, why are shares trading higher? While investors could come up with a range of reasons, one catalyst for the stock during this period likely stands out the most: Apple stock was undervalued.

One year ago, Apple stock had a mind-boggling low price-to-earnings ratio of just 10. For context, the average P/E of stocks in the S&P 500 at the time was 21.4, more than double Apple's. Combining this dirt-cheap valuation with Apple's dividend, its sizable repurchase program, and the company's long history of successful products, it was clear that the Street had oversold Apple stock as the market worried about the company's ability to continue growing its business.

Sure, Apple's stock probably didn't justify the same 20 P/E its peers in the S&P 500 averaged, but the stock almost certainly didn't deserve to trade at a P/E of 10.

What's next for Apple stock?

Going forward, can Apple stock continue soaring? While Apple's higher price-to-earnings ratio today of nearly 16 does a better job of pricing in a more optimistic outlook for the company, investors should keep in mind that the stock's 40% rise during the past 12 months doesn't automatically make Apple stock expensive today. Indeed, the stock is arguably still a buy.

For Apple to live up to its valuation today, the company will need to return to more consistent revenue growth and maintain pricing power -- two outcomes that shouldn't be a problem for the company. Yes, revenue and EPS are down in the trailing 12 months, but Apple's return to growth recently, it's fast-growing services segment, and consistently strong pricing power, all point to a bright future for Apple's business -- and a bright future for the underlying business when a stock is trading at just 16 times earnings likely means the stock will perform well, too. 1 More Sign That Apple Inc.'s New MacBook Pro Computers Are a Huge Hit Back in October of 2016, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released much-needed refreshes of its MacBook Pro product line. Thanks to the launch of these new systems, Apple broke the long losing streak that its Mac business had been seeing, and reported 1.1% year-over-year Mac unit growth, as well as roughly 7% Mac revenue growth in its most recent quarter, implying a boost in Mac average selling prices.

Although the numbers clearly speak for themselves, there's one more bit of information that Apple disclosed on its most recent earnings call that points to positive customer reception of the company's new MacBook Pro systems.

Supply constraints curbed growth

Apple CEO Tim Cook said that that Apple was "supply constrained for the new MacBook Pro throughout the December quarter and is just now coming into supply/demand balance" for the systems.

Additionally, CFO Luca Maestri offered some commentary about the company's Mac channel inventory dynamics, saying that the company "ended the quarter at the low end of [Apple's] four to five week target range for Mac channel inventory."

Apple sells many different Mac products besides the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar -- including the older discounted MacBook Pro models, MacBook Air, 12-inch MacBook, and iMac -- so even though Apple apparently ended the quarter within its target channel inventory range, channel inventory levels of the new MacBook Pro systems may have been at lower levels.

What's next for the Mac?

Apple has a reasonable shot of continuing to outperform the broader personal computer market again, especially if it gets back to putting out new/refreshed systems at a regular pace.

Next up, I expect Apple to refresh its desktop systems. The ones that Apple currently has for sale are now a generation behind in processor technology, so at the very least, the company ought to offer models with the latest chips.

The performance boost from the new chips won't be earth-shattering -- generation-on-generation improvements in personal-computer performance are hardly dramatic these days -- but it's easier to market systems with the latest processors than it is to try to market ones with previous-generation processors, especially when the competition has moved to the newer ones.

I also expect Apple to refresh the 12-inch MacBook system soon. The current models use older processors, so at the very least, a processor upgrade is in order. Once again, this is not the sort of thing that's going to be fundamentally game changing, but a better, faster system should be easier to sell.

After those systems are updated, I expect Apple to go back and update the MacBook Pro lineup again. I don't expect significant changes like the ones the company brought with the ones launched back in October 2016, but improved processor technology, and perhaps a larger battery, could make for a "good enough" upgrade.

Apple doesn't need to deliver "revolutionary" Mac products to the market to do reasonably well -- the company's brand power, its reputation for excellent customer support, and perhaps even the strength of macOS relative to Windows, to some potential buyers should be enough to allow the company to at least perform with the market, if not steadily gain share.

However, as we saw in the last year, if Apple doesn't regularly refresh its product line, keeping it stale in an already muted personal-computer market, then there will be less incentive for current Mac owners to upgrade, and it will become harder to convince Windows users to switch over.

For the sake of Apple's Mac business, let's hope that the company has plans for annual product refreshes to keep things interesting. Avoid This One Pothole When Valuing Apple Shares  Apple Inc.: The Greatest Cash Machine In History? As as sports fan, watching Brady and Belichick win the Super Bowl, Roger Federer triumph at the Australian Open and LeBron James carry the Cleveland Cavaliers to victory over the Warriors, it struck me how we take uncommon brilliance for granted. It is so easy, in the moment, to find fault, as many have, with these superstars and miss how special they are. That was the same reaction that I had as I watched another earnings report from Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the usual mix of reactions to it, some ho hum that the company made only $45 billion last year, some relieved that the company was able to post a 3% growth rate in revenues and the usual breast beating from those who found fault with it for not delivering another earth-shaking disruption. Since this is a company that I have valued after every quarterly earnings report since 2010, I thought this would be a good time to both take stock of what the company has managed to do over the last decade and to value it, given where it stands today.

The Cash Machine Revs up

In my last post on dividend payout and cash return globally, I noted that large cash balances don t happen by accident but are a direct result of companies paying out less than they have available as potential dividends or free cash flows to equity, year after year. Since Apple s cash balance almost reached $250 billion in its most recent quarterly report, by far the largest cash balance ever accumulated by a publicly traded company, I decided that the place to start was by looking at how it got to its current level. I started by collecting the operating, debt financing and reinvestment cash flows each year from 2007 to 2016 and computing a free cash flow to equity (or potential dividend) each year.

Starting in 2014, when Apple started to tap into its debt capacity, the company has been able to add to its potential dividends each year. In 2016 alone, Apple generated $93.6 billion in FCFE or potential dividends, an astounding amount, larger that the GDP of half the countries in the world in 2015. Each year, I also looked at how much Apple has returned to stockholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks.

Note that while Apple took a while to start returning cash, and it needed prompting from David Einhorn and Carl Icahn, it not only initiated dividends in 2013 but has supplemented those dividends with stock buybacks of increasing magnitude each year. In fact, Apple returned $183 billion in cash to stockholders in the last five years, making it, by far, the largest cash-returner in the world over that period.

There are two amazing (at least to me) aspects to this story. The first is that in spite of the immense amounts of cash that Apple has returned each year, its cash balance has increased each year, partly because its operating cash flows are so high and partly because they are being supplemented by debt payments. You can see the cash build up between 2007 and 2016 in the chart below:

Note that while Apple was returning $183 billion in cash between 2013-2016, its cash balance continued to increase, as its cash inflows increased even more. If having a cash spigot that never turns off is a problem, Apple has it, but I am sure that it will not get about as much sympathy from the rest of the world as a supermodel who complains that she cannot put on weight, no matter how much she eats. The other equally surprising feature of this story is that Apple s managers have not felt the urge (yet) to use their huge cash reserves to buy a company, a whole set of companies or even an entire country, a fact that those who like Apple will attribute to the discipline of its management and Apple haters will argue is due to a lack of imagination.

My Apple Valuation History

As many of you who have been reading this blog are aware, I have valued Apple many times before but rather than rehash old history, let me summarize. For Apple, the story that I have been telling about the company for the last five years has been remarkably unchanged. In my July 2012 valuation, where I looked at Apple just after it had become the largest market cap company in the world and had come off perhaps the greatest decade of disruption of any company in history (iTunes, iPod, iPhone and iPad), I concluded that while Apple was one of the great cash machines of all time, its days of disruption were behind it, partly because Steve Jobs was no longer at the helm but mostly because of its size; it is so much more difficult for a $600 billion company to create a significant enough disruption to change the trend lines on earnings, cash flows and value.

So, in my story, I saw Apple continuing to produce cash flows, with low revenue growth and gradually decreasing margins, as the smartphone business became more competitive. I won t make you read all of the posts that I have on Apple, but let me start with a post that I had in August 2015, when I updated the Apple story (and looked at Facebook and Twitter at the same time). The value I estimated for Apple in that post was $130, higher than the stock price of $110 at the time, prompting me to buy the stock. I revisited the story after an earnings report from Apple in February 2016 and compared it to Alphabet. At the time, I valued AAPL at about $126 per share, well above the $94/share that it was trading at the time. In May 2016, Carl Icahn, a long time bull on Apple sold his shares, and Warren Buffett, a long time avoider of tech companies, bought shares in the company. In a post at the time, I argued that while these big names entering and exiting the stock may have pricing consequences, I saw no reason to change my story and thus my value, leaving my Apple holdings intact.

Apple's Earnings Report & My Narrative

Last week, Apple released its latest 10Q and in conjunction with its latest 10K (Apple's fiscal year end is in September). It contained a modicum of good news, insofar as there was growth in revenues as opposed to the decline posted in the prior quarter and still-solid profit margins, but the revenue growth was only 3% and the margins are still lower than they used to be. Using the numbers in the most recent report, I took at look at my Apple story and guess what? It looks just like it did last year, a great cash machine, with very slow-growing revenues and declining margins. Using the process that I describe, perhaps in too much detail in my book on narrative and numbers, I converted my story in inputs to my valuation: Vanguard Group hikes passive stake in Apple to 6.3 pct from 5.8 pct  
2017-03-23
Why Apple Inc. Is So Profitable Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the world's most profitable companies and certainly the most profitable smartphone maker. Per Strategy Analytics (by way of MacRumors), Apple captured 79% of all smartphone industry profits in 2016, while rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) took in 14.6% (leaving very little for the many remaining industry players).

What isn't often talked about -- even in the financial media -- is why Apple's iPhone franchise (and, indeed, Apple itself) is so incredibly profitable.

I think this is an important topic for investors, and even simply individuals interested in the smartphone business, to understand. To that end, I'd like to explain.

How are profits calculated?

There are several types of profit, or income, that you should be aware of. There's gross profit, operating profit, and net profit.

Gross profit refers to the amount of money that the company gets to keep from the sale of each product after cost of goods sold -- think of that as the per unit production cost -- is subtracted from the selling price of the product.

A concrete example: if I sell a smartphone for $150 that costs me $100 to make, then my gross profit is $50. My gross profit margin percentage in this case is the ratio of gross profit ($50) to selling price ($150), or 33%.

You'll notice that while gross profit is an interesting metric, it doesn't consider another critical financial factor: operating expenses. A company like Apple must constantly invest in research and development to bring new products into the world and there are other expenses such as product marketing, administrative functions, and so on.

Operating profit, then, can be thought of as gross profit less operating expenses.

Finally, there's net profit. You can think of this as operating profit with some other factors baked in including tax liabilities, losses/gains from investments, one-time accounting charges, and so on.

With that background in mind, we can now understand why Apple is so profitable.

High revenue, solid gross profit margins, and relatively low operating expenses

In its last fiscal year, Apple reported net revenue of $215.64 billion -- a substantial sum. On that revenue, it generated gross profit of $84.26 billion. Its operating expenses, split between research and development (R&D) and sales, general, and administrative (SG&A), totaled $24.24 billion.

As a simple calculation shows, Apple generated $60 billion in operating income and, less taxes and including in "other income," its net income worked out to $45.69 billion.

From these numbers, the key to Apple's profitability is clear: extremely high revenues, a robust gross profit margin percentage on that revenue, and relatively low operating expenses as a percentage of revenue (enabled in no small part by the fact that its revenue base is so huge).

What's particularly impressive is that the company is able to move north of $200 billion in product with an SG&A budget of just shy of $14.2 billion.

In contrast, Apple rival Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) generated roughly $179 billion in total revenues last year (it's worth noting that Samsung's business is more diversified than Apple's) but it needed to spend roughly $47 billion in SG&A to get to that level of revenue.

In other words, Apple's sales and marketing organization is effective and its brand so powerful that Apple can spend a fraction of what its fiercest competitor does and still generate more revenue.

Apple's a well-run business

One thing is crystal clear: Apple is a phenomenally run business that gets a lot of mileage from its operating expenses. Its ability to build desirable products and effectively market them in such an efficient manner is highly impressive and, should Apple keep it up, could serve to generate additional shareholder value in the future. Apple, Inc. Reportedly Preparing to Begin Manufacturing iPhones in India There's been a lot of talk over the past few months about where Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may or may not expand its manufacturing footprint. President Trump would naturally like it if Apple brought some manufacturing jobs back home, despite the massive cost increases that would come along with such a move. But Apple has long faced challenges with expanding sales in India in part due to a government requirement that requires 30% of a product to be locally sourced in order to open single-branded retail stores.

Following reports that the Mac maker was considering moving forward with having one of its contract manufacturing partners set up shop in India, The Wall Street Journal says the initiative is almost a go.

Just a couple months away

Taiwanese contract manufacturer Wistron is reportedly in the final stages of moving forward with opening an iPhone manufacturing facility that will produce the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, and iPhone SE. iPhone 6 and 6s production could commence in as little as four to six weeks, while the iPhone SE is scheduled to start being produced in roughly three months.

By assembling iPhones in the country, retail prices should come down by approximately $100, as Apple should be able to avoid having to pay import duties. Apple's pricing still sits out of reach for many Indian consumers, so every little bit that it can do to incrementally reduce prices is welcome; the company has long suffered from single-digit market share in India.

And if manufacturing the handsets locally can help Apple meet the 30% local sourcing requirement, it could also pave the way for Apple retail stores, which are strategically important distribution channels where Apple can control and maintain consistent customer experiences.

That's what he said

Over the years, Apple has vaguely made comments that it wants to expand more in India, but we've only started to see meaningful action in the past year or two. The good news is that the company is already seeing results, and India is becoming one of its fastest-growing geographical markets. That may not say much since its business there is relatively small, so high growth rates aren't all that hard to hit, but CEO Tim Cook's comments throughout 2016 are certainly encouraging.

April 2016 earnings call:

From an India point of view, if you look at India, and each country has a different story a bit, but the things that have held not only us back, perhaps, but some others as well, is that the LTE rollout with India just really begins this year. So we will begin to see some really good networks coming on in India. That will unleash the power and capability of the iPhone, in a way that an older network, 2.5G or even some 3G networks, would not do. The infrastructure is one key one, and the second one is building the channel out.

July 2016 earnings call:

India is now one of our fastest-growing markets. In the first three quarters of this fiscal year, our iPhone sales in India were up 51% year on year. We just announced a first-of-its-kind design and development accelerator to support Indian developers creating innovative applications for iOS, and we opened a new office in Hyderabad to accelerate Maps development. We're looking forward to opening retail stores in India down the road, and we see huge potential for that vibrant country.

October 2016 earnings call:

On India, I think it's important to look not only at per capita income, which may be what you're looking at, but sort of look at the number of people that are or will move into the middle class over the next decade. And, the age of the population -- if you look at India, almost 50% of the population is under 25. So, you have a very, very young population. The smartphone has not done as well in India in general.

On the January 2017 earnings call, Cook noted that despite India's move toward demonetization, which has hurt some companies there, Apple enjoyed "all-time record revenue results" in the country. It only goes up from here. 5 Reasons China Is Still Key for Apple, Inc. In Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) most recent quarter, revenue in Greater China, which includes China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, was down 12% year over year. With the operating segment accounting for about 21% of Apple's total revenue, it's no surprise some investors are concerned with Apple's performance in the market. After all, this is a far cry from the segment's high growth in the past. In the first quarter of 2016, Greater China revenue increased 14% year over year, growing faster than any other market. And looking even further back, Greater China revenue skyrocketed 70% year over year in the first quarter of 2015.

Has Apple's market opportunity in China come to a sudden halt or -- even worse -- begun to retract? I don't think so. Here are five reasons Apple's China business is still thriving.

1. Revenue was flat year over year in Mainland China during Q1. So China is faring better than Apple's overall Greater China operating segment. However, even this understates how Apple is doing in China. Adjusting for currency headwinds, Apple's revenue in the market was up 6%. Finally, investors should realize that Apple was up against a tough comparison; its year-ago quarterly China revenue was an all-time record for the company.

2. Unit Mac sales in China grew by a double-digit percentage in Q1. The only other markets that achieved year-over-year double-digit percentage growth during the quarter were Japan, India, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the U.S. education market. As Apple's most expensive products, Macs deeply entrench customers into the Apple ecosystem and can lead to follow-up purchases in the future. Overall Mac unit sales increased just 1% during the quarter.

3. iPad unit sales also posted double-digit growth in China during Q1. This crushed Apple's overall 19% year-over-year decline in iPad units for all of its operating segments combined during the quarter. The only other market with similarly robust growth in iPad unit sales was India.

4. 50% of iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers. Apple CEO Tim Cook said this "is a very high number that we're pleased with." More switchers and first-time buyers mean that Apple is growing its installed base of users, which management hopes to further monetize with repeat purchases, app sales, and services.

5. In 2016, Apple's App Store revenue soared 90%, the company said in a Jan. 5 press release. To give the significance of Apple's App Store revenue in China some more context, quarterly App Store revenue in China surpassed the U.S. by over 15% during the third quarter of last year, according to estimates by App Annie. This makes China Apple's largest market for its App store.

Clearly, China is still critical to Apple's business. And based on these figures, it looks like the market may still have more room to run. Sure, tough comparisons throughout 2017 may make growth in Apple's overall Greater China segment difficult. But a strong trajectory for sales in China across multiple product segments suggests the country could help Apple's Greater China segment return to growth in the future. Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. Samsung Welcome to the consumer electronics equivalent of an Ali-Frazier fight. To consider just one area where they compete, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) so dominate the smartphone and tablet businesses that between them, the two tech giants regularly account for more than 90% of smartphone industry profits in any given quarter. Clearly, these are powerhouses.

As to which is the better buy today, the answer is far less clear. This article will run Samsung and Apple through a three-part analysis to gauge which tech company's shares looks like the better investment right now.

Financial fortitude

The Ali-Frazier analogy certainly holds true in the financial analysis of these two famously profitable companies. To give this discussion some color, here a quick review of some of the most important solvency and liquidity metrics for Apple and Samsung.

Company Cash & Investments Debts Cash from Operations Current Ratio Apple $246.1 billion $87.5 billion $65.4 billion 1.2 Samsung $76.8 billion $13.3 billion $41.3 billion 2.6

As you can see, both companies are paragons of financial stability. However, as has received plenty of attention in recent years, the bulk of Apple's current cash and investments reside in overseas accounts; it reported having $230 billion overseas in its most recent Form 10-Q. Apple has adeptly borrowed against that debt to fund its various capital return efforts, but Samsung does not face such an issue. Regardless, Apple enjoys substantially more net cash and produces over $20 billion more cash from its operations than Samsung. So while neither company is a pauper, Apple earns a win in this first category.

Winner: Apple

Durable competitive advantages

Given that they are two of the largest and most powerful companies in the world, it takes no grand insight to see that both Apple and Samsung enjoy competitive advantages to varying degrees.

Apple's cash hoard is it own competitive advantage, giving it unparalleled flexibility to pursue whatever potential strategic goals it desires. Apple's largest source of staying power, though, is its closed-loop ecosystem, which is buttressed in equal degrees by its leading hardware design, iOS software, app ecosystem, and prized brand. In combination, these factors allow Apple to command far higher prices for its devices than most other consumer electronics manufacturers do for similar equipment.

These higher per-unit prices translate into above-average margins for Apple. As just one example, the Mac maker produced a net income margin of 20.7% over the past 12 months, more than twice the S&P 500's average profit margin according to FactSet data. However, Apple's success also rests on its ability to consistently create and market sleek devices that consumers love. Though it has yet to have a stumble on that front in the iPhone era, failure to execute its well-worn playbook in any given year could adversely affect the company's financial performance and stock price.

As one of the largest electronics makers in the world, Samsung should be able to maintain its place atop of the global tech industry over the long term. The company operates three main reporting segments: consumer electronics (TVs, appliances, etc.), IT & mobile communications (smartphones), and device solutions (semiconductors and displays). Consumer electronics and IT & mobile produced operating margins of roughly 5% and 10% respectively in 2016; call them average to below-average businesses based on the FactSet profit margin numbers cited earlier. However, Samsung's semiconductor unit, which designs and manufactures a host of chips for itself and other electronics firms, is the financial engine that powers its performance; the unit produced 20% operating margins in 2016.

In the category of near-term risks, Samsung's place in South Korea's growing political corruption scandal creates something of an overhang for the chaebol, the Korean word for the handful of large conglomerates that dominate the business landscape in the East Asian country. Last month, Samsung CEO Jay Y. Lee was arrested and will be indicted on charges including "bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury" as part of the investigation that lead to South Korean president Park Geun-hye's impeachment. In all likelihood, this shouldn't damage Samsung's long-term business outlook, though it certainly could create issues for the company and its management structure in the coming quarters.

Winner: Apple

Valuation

Turning the final segment of our analysis, let's take a look at three of the most popular valuation metrics for the two companies.

Company P/E

Forward P/E EV/EBITDA Apple 16.9 13.9 10.9 Samsung 13.5 9.5 4.6

Importantly, Apple's massive hoard of cash and investments artificially inflates its valuation. As I recently pointed out, subtracting Apple's net cash and investments from its market capitalization actually lowers Apple's current P/E ratio to around 12.5, depending on Apple's current stock price. Knowing that Apple is cheaper than Samsung and enjoys superior economics to the South Korean powerhouse -- see the durable competitive advantages section above -- totally reframes this discussion in Apple's favor.

Before wrapping up this section, it's also worth mentioning that both Apple and Samsung are materially undervalued compared to the market averages; the S&P 500 currently trades at a pricey 26-times earnings. So though Apple earns a win in this section, both companies appear at least somewhat under-priced.

Winner: Apple

And the winner is... Apple

By virtue of winning all three segments, Apple earns itself an easy win in comparison to Samsung. That isn't to say Samsung isn't an interesting investment as one of the strongest companies in all of tech, especially when taking its rock-bottom valuation into consideration. However, to quote the classic film Highlander, "There can be only one," and Apple pretty clearly stands as that one -- the better stock of these two dueling tech companies to own today. Apple Acquires DeskConnect For Workflow Application  Thinking Of Selling Apple? Read This First In May of 2016 shares of Cupertino-based Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were trading hands around $90. Today the number is closer to $141 - or a 55%+ increase in less than a year. And with this information alone some investors might be looking to dispose of their stake. Yet there are a variety of additional factors to consider.

Come Up With A Baseline

This is an obvious one, but all too often investors react to price action rather than the value currently being offered. I'm reminded that just because a better deal was once available this does not simultaneously mean that today's proposition is now a poor one.

For the past 12 months Apple has reported per share earnings of $8.35. It depends on where you look, but the expectation is for this number to grow in the 7% to 12% range over the intermediate-term.

Just to give you some reference points, over the past decade, Apple grew revenues by 27% per year, company-wide earnings by 37% annually and earnings-per-share by over 38% per annum. Naturally you would not expect anything close that reoccurring, but you can see a relationship: these growth rates highlight a greatly improved net margin (from 10% to 21%) and the start of the repurchase program (from about 6 billion common shares outstanding down to 5.3 billion).

During the past four years Apple was able to grow revenue by 8% annually, company-wide profits by just over 2% per year and earnings-per-share by 7% per annum. Once again, you can glean some information. Notably, just because company-wide profits slowed materially (the net profit margin went from almost 27% down to 21%) this alone does not mean that per share results were poor. Instead, a substantial share repurchase program has aided in shareholder results.

Which brings us to today. It may be your view that the business cannot grow exceptionally, but this alone does not indicate that shareholder results are going to be lackluster. Even on the lower end of expectations - say 7% annual growth - the potential return could still be reasonable.

It's important to come up with your own baseline, but using 7% yearly growth results in the expectation of $11.70 or so in earnings after five years. For Apple it's difficult to come up with a "typical" earnings multiple, but something around 13 to 17 times earnings has been somewhat reasonable going back to the last recession. At 15 times earnings you would anticipate a future price of about $176 (keeping in mind this is merely a starting place).

Apple currently pays a $0.57 quarterly dividend which is apt to increase over the years. Certainly there is room for payout expansion (the cash payment only makes up about a fourth of current earnings power) but for this example let's suppose that the dividend grows in line with earnings.

Under this circumstance you might also anticipate collecting $14 or so in cash payments during the next half decade. In total your baseline value expectation would be around $190 - representing a total gain of just over 6% per annum.

Now I would like to highlight that this is not an exceptional return expectation. (To underscore this, using the same assumptions as above but with a $90 starting price instead, results in the anticipation of 16% annual gains.) However, it does not exactly equate to a terrible outcome either. Here you have a security that has increased in price materially and yet the potential return from this point could still be reasonable.

The Quality Of The Business

A second item of note is the quality of the business. There are only so many firms in the world and only a very select few generate tens of billions of dollars in profit. This idea can get lost as you page through tickers, but each symbol represents an honest stake in a partnership.

Beyond the profit generating machine, you have things that tend to go along with it like exceptional margins, an enviable balance sheet position and plenty of wiggle room for capital deployment. This matters for a lot of reasons, but shows up most readily with things like a dividend and earnings-per-share growth rate that could easily outpace business performance from this point. The "loaded spring" of a solid balance sheet and low payout ratio allow for shareholder returns to continue even as business results begin to slow down.

Selling Apple is easy. Finding a replacement with similar quality characteristics may not be so simple. Which, incidentally, brings us to the next point:

Frictional Expenses

Naturally this varies greatly by individual (in terms of timing and holding structure) but it could play a very important (although still secondary) role. Suppose you purchased 100 shares of Apple less than a year ago at $90. Today you could sell that stake for roughly $14,100 (less fees) and also potentially less taxes. At short-term rates this has the potential of eating up $2,000 worth of gains, bringing your total down to $121 or so per share.

At that level suddenly your "investment bar baseline" that we outlined above goes from around 6% per year all the way up to 9.4% or so per annum. Of course everyone's tax and frictional expense situation is going to be different. The point is that it's not just comparing Apple to your alternatives - it's comparing Apple after you have dealt with expenses.

The Possibility Of Being Wrong

Finally, there is a very real possibility of being wrong in your predictions. Just because you dream up a set of assumptions this does not immediately make it so. The company generally has no idea that you expect say 4% or 7% or 10% growth. In this light, it can be helpful to come up with a wide range of scenarios:

The above table shows potential earnings-per-share growth rates on the left-hand side and ending P/E ratios on the top. At the intersection of each component you can see what the average compound total return would be to the nearest whole number. Note that the dividend is presumed to increase in line with earnings.

So as an illustration, you can see our hypothetical baseline from above take form in the green box or at the intersection of 7% annual growth and an ending multiple of 15. This table is certainly not all encompassing, but it does give you a fairly wide range of possible outcomes.

If your assumptions are more cautious - less than 7% growth or less than 15 times earnings - the potential results may not be that impressive. Alternatively, your assumptions could just as easily be too conservative. The yellow highlighted squares demonstrate the possibility of being wrong and Apple actually performing even better than you had imagined.

Not only would the potential returns be higher, but finding a replacement would get more difficult. Instead of looking to replace a security with the potential to generate say 6% to 9% annual comparative gains, you could be looking at having to replace 10%-plus returns. The point is that your baseline is going to be very precise, but you should probably bake in some uncertainty with your estimates.

In short, this piece should not dissuade you from selling your stake - that's a personal investment decision. However, perhaps it adds some context before making a snap judgment. Even though Apple's share price has increased materially in the last year, there are a variety of additional considerations at play. For starters, your potential return from this point could still be reasonable. Beyond that you have to further consider the quality of the holding, frictional expenses and the very real possibility of being wrong in your assumptions.

Apple Inc. valuation now more than $134 billion greater than Alphabet's Google Shares of Apple are collectively worth $713.96 billion as of today's market close, while the market cap of Alphabet Inc (which includes Google) closed today at $579.15 billion, a difference of $134.81 billion. However, Google's search results still point to year-old stories touting Google briefly surpassing Apple in market cap twice last spring.





Google's old results haven't been accurate for months





Apple valuation up, P/E still very low

The massive over-valution of surveillance based advertising

Facebook's market cap ($389.23 billion) is almost half as large as Apple's despite achieving quarterly revenues that are close to a tenth of Apple's ($78.4 billion)

If you search Google for "apple google valuation," the search giant's primary "featured snippet" answer is supplied from a year old Quartz blog entry by Melvin Backman, who portrayed the event (last February 1) as the "New Normal," rather than a passing moment of irrationality in the market. Apple passed up again Google within a couple weeks of that being written.If you click Google's suggested "People Also Ask" question for "Is Google or Apple worth more?" the answer it gives is derived from an article published by CNBC last May, when Google shares again briefly passed Apple's. However, for most of the past year since, Apple's market cap has hovered about $40 billion on top of Google.This month, Apple's shares jumped significantly following its earnings report from the December quarter, boosted by strong sales of iPhones and Macs, as well as the 18 percent growth of its Services business that's now achieving quarterly revenues of $7.17 billion.The tech media narrative from last year that decried a shrinking smartphone market and imagined a " boring iPhone 7 " helped to suppress Apple's stock price, but that story couldn't withstand the real sales numbers achieved at the release of new iPhones and MacBook Pros, as well as record sales of Apple Watch and Services including App Store sales and Apple Music.Despite the increase in Apple's share price, the company still trades at a Price/Earnings ratio of 16.36, far lower than Google's 29.32. In other words, the market is still putting a much larger valuation on Google's ability to make money than Apple's, despite the fact that Apple continues to earn more money and successfully launch products that Google continues to fail at.That's particularly visible in smartphones with the Google Pixel, which did little for Google nor its hardware partner HTC. But Google has also stumbled in wearables, tablets and laptops, indicating an strong inability to take Apple's business away at will, despite many years and trying many different strategies.Google's $26.06 billion in total revenues during the December quarter (and $5.5 billion in quarterly net income) were significantly lower than Apple's $78.35 billion in quarterly revenues (and $17.89 billion in net income).However, more attention was directed to the idea that Apple earns most of its profits from a single family of products (iPhones) than the fact that virtually all of Google's profits come from surveillance based advertising. That's a market that is not only facing strong competition from players including Facebook, but is also at risk from ad blocking and a general user dissatisfaction with being tracked and sold to advertisers.Apple's $7.17 billion from its Services unit alone approaches the revenue of all of Facebook ($8.81 billion), but Facebook shares trade at a P/E of 38.99, meaning Facebook's market cap ($389.23 billion) is almost half as large as Apple's despite achieving quarterly revenues that are close to a tenth of Apple's ($78.4 billion).Like Google, Facebook also has a business model that depends almost entirely upon ads, and that faces real competition from both the incumbent Google and encroaching new players including Snap. Unlike Apple, Facebook and Google have no entry into the Chinese market, and little potential to enter it.Apple's luxury electronics and proprietary app development platforms are unrivaled on a global level, and Apple is the only company with strong market share in both the U.S. and China, the world's two largest markets for smartphones and related products. Apple: The Song Remains The Same At the end of the day however, what really matters is the iPhone, which represents 70% of revenue.

It never ceases to amaze me the amount of information that is published an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on a daily basis. Countless websites on a daily basis publish even the slightest news or rumor on AAPL.

Countless analysts also publish estimates on the company and work their models to the bone, trying to figure out what AAPL will report, so their clients might have an edge over everyone else.

Does all this information matter, when at the end of the day one wants to make an investment decision? My answer is no.

The latest craze pertaining to AAPL are services. For some reason analysts and pundits alike think that services will be the next big thing that might propel AAPL's value to $1 trillion.

While APPL may indeed at some point be valued at $1 trillion, it will not happen because of a rise in service revenue. This much I can guarantee you.

Let's look at Apple's profits

As you know, when AAPL reported its year-end results back in September 2016, it recorded its first Y/Y lower revenue and profit in many years.

Then in its first quarter ending December 31, 2016, AAPL also reported something really strange. While revenue was higher Y/Y, net profit for the company was lower.

source

Now let's look at AAPL's quarterly revenue and profit picture.

AAPL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts

If you notice above, quarterly revenue and net income is more or less at par where it has been for many quarters now.

In fact, one wonders why AAPL shares have appreciated so much recently with revenue growth and profits increasing by miniscule amounts.

Let's talk service revenue

The question is, why did AAPL report lower profits in Q1? It sounds a little strange if you ask me. I mean, especially since services are the up and coming revenue segment, that will propel AAPL to over $1 trillion in market cap.

source

If we look at the product revenue mix for Q1, we will notice that services were up by 18% Y/Y for AAPL's Q1. However please note that this is actually down from a 24% increase from AAPL's Q4'2016 report. So in other words, service growth seems to be flattening out on a sequential basis.

But how can service growth be flattening out? Isn't service growth the next big thing? And the even bigger question is, why did AAPL report fewer profits in Q1 with services growing by around 20%?

Well one answer is that services are it still a small component of overall sales, around 12%. The second is that the biggest sub-component within services growth is AAPL's streaming music service.

See, AAPL's music service might be growing logarithmically (about 2 million paid users per month), but AAPL makes very little profits from it. How so? Well because we also know that Pandora (NYSE:P) and Spotify (Private:MUSIC) don't make any money either. And the reason they do not make any money is because most of the revenue is a cost that is passed along to the music industry.

So while service revenue might be growing around 20%, half of that growth comes from AAPL's streaming music division that's probably making very little money, if it's making money at all.

I have no doubt that the music division will end up having 100 million subscribers at some point, but do not expect much profit from it. And do not expect APPL to become a $1 trillion company based on services. At least not based on today's data.

So why is AAPL's share price at record highs?

The main reason is the chart below:

AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts

The answer is the float. As long as AAPL continues to produce mountains of net profit - irrespective of growth - the stock will keep rising.

In fact, even with zero growth, AAPL's stock should keep rising indefinitely as long as APPL repurchases shares on the open market.

And if the above chart is not evidence enough for you, the next chart below should be enough to convince you:

AAPL Market Cap data by YCharts

In we look at the market cap of AAPL, it's only about 10% higher than the highs of 2012 and lower that the high of 2015! This despite the stock recently roaring to an all-time high.

In other words, if it were not for stock repurchases, chances are that APPL's stock might have underperformed the past several years.

Bottom line

The way I see it, AAPL's stock has nothing to do with individual revenue segments, especially services. I mean yes, everything plays a role, however everything is still about the iPhone and its fat profit margins that still represent about 70% of total AAPL revenue.

I have no doubt the iPhone 8, or the rumored iPhone X, will be a another home run for AAPL. Why? Because it's always a home run. Because AAPL's next iPhone will be the best device it ever made, and will sell as good or better than every previous iPhone device, because that's what always happens.

It does not matter what the specs on any future iPhone will be because whatever they are, they will be better than any other smartphone device and will have the gross margins that we have come to expect from AAPL.

On can rant all day about revenue segments, service growth and how great the next iPhone will be. However when coming to an investment decision, AAPL's stock is still about share repurchases and the dividend, which currently yields about 2.25%.

As long as AAPL is able to make the profits it makes, even with no revenue or profit growth, the song will remain the same. And that song is mainly share repurchases.

Warren Buffett Nearly Quadrupled His Apple, Inc. Position Last Quarter So much for that aversion to tech.

The Oracle of Omaha made waves last year when Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A) (NYSE:BRK-B) disclosed that it had picked up a cool $1 billion worth of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares, enough to scoop up 9.8 million shares. It's worth noting that this initial investment decision was not made by Buffett himself, but rather one of his lieutenants.

Berkshire then proceeded to buy an additional 5.4 million shares in the second quarter of 2016, increasing its position to 15.2 million shares valued $1.5 billion at the time. There was no reported change in the number of shares during the third quarter, although Berkshire enjoyed some gains as shares rose. Berkshire has just filed its Form 13F for the fourth quarter, and it nearly quadrupled its Apple position.

Berkshire is now sitting on 57.4 million shares of the Mac maker, valued at $6.6 billion at the end of last year. Not many investors can say this, but Buffett now has a 1% stake in Apple, which is a pretty tall order when we're talking about a $700 billion company. You can count on one hand the number of institutional investors that have a stake greater than or equal to Buffett's, and most of those are fund families that aggregate reported holdings across different funds.

Apple was a big chunk of Buffett's buying spree

In an interview with Charlie Rose a few weeks back, Buffett noted that Berkshire had acquired $12 billion in common stock in the wake of the election, which represented a significant increase in buying activity. In contrast, Berkshire bought approximately $10 billion worth of equities through all of 2015.

While some of that $12 billion was seemingly purchased after the new year, and we don't know what prices Berkshire was buying Apple at, it's safe to say that a good chunk of that money was allocated to the Mac maker. Apple's average share price during the fourth quarter was right around $113, which would translate into $4.8 billion based on the additional 42.1 million shares purchased during the quarter.

Of course, Buffett is far from a market timer, but with shares currently trading at all-time highs, the increased position is already faring quite well. Shares are already up 17% year to date, thanks in part to a record fourth-quarter earnings release.

Cash flow is one of Buffett's favorite investing metrics, particularly compared to figures like net income, which are subject to more qualitative judgments from management and more prone to manipulation in general. Apple has cash flow in spades, and currently has the largest cash position of any company ever. The tech titan generated over $65 billion in operating cash flow in 2016, of which $52 billion was free cash flow.

If Buffett thinks Apple is undervalued enough to nearly quadruple Berkshire's position, he's probably on to something. Will Apple, Inc. Really Double Its Services Business in 4 Years? About a year ago, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) began spending more time discussing its services business during its quarterly earnings calls. It's pretty clear why it decided to do so -- the services segment is the only aspect of Apple's business that's still growing consistently.

On the first-quarter earnings call last month, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced an ambitious goal of doubling the company's services revenue in the next four years. That's a big reason why Apple stock has rallied more than 10% in the past few weeks, reaching a new all-time high.

Plenty of analysts and other pundits are skeptical that it will be feasible to double the services business in four years, barring a big acquisition. But here are three reasons doubling the services business might not be so hard after all.

Services growth is accelerating

First, the services segment's growth trajectory is better than it seems. For Q1 of fiscal 2017, Apple reported an 18% year over year increase in services revenue, down from 26% growth a year earlier.

These figures make it seem like Apple's services growth is already slowing. Considering that Apple needs to grow its services revenue at a 19% compound annual rate to double it in four years, this would be an ominous sign.

However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, Apple benefited from a one-time $548 million gain related to a patent infringement lawsuit. Excluding that patent revenue, Apple's services revenue grew only 15% in Q1 2016, but surged 30% year over year last quarter. Thus, Apple doesn't even need to maintain its recent services growth rate to hit its target.

The App Store is gaining scale

A second factor working in Apple's favor is that the App Store has recently become the largest contributor to Apple's services revenue.

App sales have been growing at a fast clip for many years, but Apple only reports its net revenue from the App Store. The portion of App Store sales that goes to developers -- which ranges from 70%-85% -- doesn't show up in Apple's financial statements. Apple earns an extremely high profit margin on App Store revenue due to this accounting policy, but the growth of this revenue stream hasn't been very material until recently.

Wall Street analyst Toni Sacconaghi estimates that Apple's net App Store revenue reached $7.3 billion in the 2016 fiscal year that ended last September. That would make it the largest piece of Apple's services segment, ahead of iTunes, which faces secular revenue declines.

Furthermore, the App Store continues to grow at a phenomenal pace. Last month, Apple reported that developers' earnings rose more than 40% year over year during 2016. The pace of growth is sure to slow over time, but App Store revenue is on a trajectory to more than double in the next four years, providing a good chunk of the services revenue growth Apple is targeting.

The iPhone Upgrade Program could lift AppleCare revenue

Growth of the iPhone Upgrade Program is a third factor that could contribute to increases in Apple's services revenue. For as little as $32.41/month, this program allows customers to get a new iPhone every year by trading in their old one. Purchases under the iPhone Upgrade Program include AppleCare+ enhanced warranty coverage, which is worth $129.

Many iPhone fans have already enrolled in the iPhone Upgrade Program, but there's still plenty of room for growth. Apple could potentially expand the program to more countries. It could also consider creating similar programs for other devices like the Apple Watch.

These Apple-operated upgrade programs can drive significant services revenue growth because AppleCare+ is part of the bundle. Very few of these customers would be buying AppleCare+ if it were still sold separately.

A big reason for optimism

Apple's services business produced more than $24 billion of revenue in fiscal 2016, up from less than $20 billion a year earlier. This allowed it to surpass both the iPad and Mac product lines to become Apple's second-largest segment by revenue.

Even if Apple misses its target of doubling its services revenue by 2020, it will certainly get a meaningful amount of revenue growth from that segment. With strong services growth ensuring that Apple's non-iPhone revenue will rise consistently in the years ahead, Apple will be well positioned to return to strong earnings growth as the next iPhone sales cycle heats up. Apple Continues Its Pivot Towards Asia Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is continuing its pivot towards Asia. Recent developments in India, China and throughout Asia point to the increasing importance of the continent to the company. Asia is integral to Apple's growth and the dominant market position in Japan can be replicated elsewhere in the region. Comments at the Q4 2016 earnings and conference call reinforce this perception of Asia's vital importance to the company. Service revenues as well as the iPhone 8 will play a major role in this process.

Q4 Results & Asia.

The Q42016 Unaudited Summary Data illustrate the importance of Asian revenue to Apple.

The blip in Greater China (which includes Hong Kong and Taiwan) should not be taken as a trend. This was more to do with difficult comparisons, a 6% currency depreciation and problems in Hong Kong.

As Tim Cook stated at the conference call:

The iPhone 7 was the best-selling smartphone in China during the quarter... we set a new record in Services in China.. We also saw 50% of our iPhone sales in China were to switchers and first-time buyers."

Q2 2016 is likely to see a very significant boost in China sales in US$ terms. The market may or may not have taken this into account in the stock price. Q3 and Q4 are likely to see a huge surge in sales with the probable release of the iPhone 8. Mac sales and iPad sales both enjoyed double-digit growth in the quarter just gone, despite the iPads' sales decline worldwide.

In terms of revenue, Asia accounted for 33.6% of total revenue. On a sequential basis, Japan had revenue growth of 23% and Rest of Asia Pacific 13%. On both a sequential and year-on-year basis, Japan (already a very strong market) had the fastest growth of any region in the world.

At the earnings call the company highlighted double-digit iPhone growth in Japan and Australia, double-digit growth for Mac in Japan and India, and double-digit growth for iPad in India. Growth in Vietnam was also emphasized. The Mac should continue to boom this year. The company was unable to keep up with demand for the new MacBook Pro in this previous quarter.

Sales were buoyant in Asia despite the currency situation everywhere there. CFO Luca Maestri in fact pointed out that since June 2014, the US$ is up 25% against emerging markets currencies. Most of the emerging market revenue for Apple is in Asia.

China

My recent article dealt with the importance of retail for the Asian markets, and for China in particular. So I will not repeat that here. At the conference call, Cook only said that the somewhat delayed Singapore store would open "soon" and there was no specific mention of retail in China.

The large-scale retail roll-out in China does continue. Apple was perhaps a bit late to the party there. Surprisingly, considering the secular bricks-and-mortar retail decline in the USA, this is vital for the Chinese market.

The newest smartphone companies booming in China are Oppo and Vivo. They have achieved this on the back of a retail strategy. This has concentrated on China's second tier cities. Former hot stock Xiaomi has seen its share collapse, based partly on its on-line sales strategy. Xiaomi is seen by many observers as an example of the dangers of hubris. New product areas it has tried to develop have included robotic vacuum cleaners. It moved too late into services: having targeted US$1 billion in services revenue last year, it is thought the company achieved half that. It is belatedly opening up bricks and mortar retail stores, with 50 being opened up.

Oppo, by comparison, has 200,000 retail outlets across the country. Oppo has had to subsidize retailers greatly to achieve the volume success and its profitability is probably quite low.

What Oppo and Vivo do not have is the ecosystem, high profitability and product range that Apple has. They are quite likely to fall away somewhat just as the once much-praised Xiaomi did. There is always another low-cost smartphone manufacturer waiting around the corner. However, one trend that is being seen is a falling away of smaller manufacturers with a few large ones consolidating their hold on the market. This should be favorable to Apple, a company which also focuses on its core competencies.

The launch of the next generation iPhone will be key to Apple differentiating itself from the competition. If as rumored it comes with a curved screen and glass back, this should make the iPhone the "must have" different gadget once again.

The possibility that it might come with augmented reality (AR) features would also be a bonus for the China market. AR is expected to take off in a big way in China. Search engine leader Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is investing heavily in the new technology, as is the leading telecoms provider China Mobile (NYSE:CHL).

The number "8" is a very auspicious number in Chinese culture, so that would not hurt as well. It is thought that the next iPhone round will have one model priced at over US$1,000. This will be a help, not a hindrance, in a market where wearing a branded status symbol item is much desired.

The graph below shows the comparison between sales in China and Europe for Apple:

It shows Tim Cook is also putting in plenty of effort in Europe in addition to Asia. It is likely though that China will overtake Europe again by the end of this year. Add on the rest of Asia, and the continent's importance dwarfs Europe. The revenue growth prospects are clear from the much lower average age of the population in Asian countries, and the far higher economic growth rates.

Apple is opening up an R & D center in Beijing this year. It follows its US$1 billion investment in Didi Chuxing. Such investments can be seen as a signal to the Chinese Government that it is serious about long-term investment in the country. Unlike Xiaomi, Cook shows no sign of neglecting Services revenue. Indeed, the opposite is true. Cook has a target worldwide to double Services revenues in 4 years.

India

I first wrote on SA about Apple's potential in China in September 2014 and then again in June 2015. At the time I was inundated by a welter of comments about how Apple would always be too expensive for China, etc. Those doubters were proved wrong. I received the same sort of comments when I began writing in 2015 about Apple's potential in India. The doubters will no doubt be proved wrong again.

Apple is looking to gain traction in the premium segment of the market, as it always does. It will then build up to a more mass market position and get Services revenue from its ecosystem. In Q4 2016, the company is estimated to have achieved 92% of profits worldwide from the smartphone market. So this strategy continues to work.

India is not China and may need local manufacturing to gain substantial market share. This now looks likely as has been commented on in numerous articles recently. A local Government statement this month indicated that a facility would be set up very soon in Bengaluru. Such statements do have to be treated with a certain amount of caution in India, however. Once iPhones are manufactured then obstacles to retail subsequently disappear.

At the results briefing, Tim Cook diplomatically commented:

We are in discussions on a number of things, including retail stores, and fully intend to invest significantly in the country."

A combination of local manufacturing, retail stores and software development centers, which I have touched on in previous articles, should set up Apple in the country.

In 2016, India's smartphone shipments reached about 300 million units. This was an increase of 18% from 2015. Smartphones are not yet a mature or saturated market in the country. India's local smartphone manufacturers had a terrible 2016. Four Chinese brands joining Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) as the top five selling brands. Apple doubled its sales to about 2.5 million iPhones. These sales were mainly in the final quarter with the release of the iPhone 7.

Japan

Japan has the highest iPhone penetration of any country in the world. Apple still managed to post sequential revenue gains of 23%. iPhones there last year accounted for a startling 51.7% of all smartphone sales. For total smartphone users, it is estimated that 66.2% are on IOS and 31.9% on Android. There are 106 million mobile phone users in general in Japan.

This is driven by an affluent population and consumers who demand smart features. The iPhone strikes a chord in a country which cherishes good design and minimalism. Generous contracts with the country's telecoms operators make the phone seem inexpensive. These are trends likely to be repeated all over Asia.

Before the successful release of the iPhone 7 in the country, the best-selling models were the Apple 6S and the Apple SE. In terms of tablets, Apple has over 40% market share. The fact that the new iPhone was dust and water-resistant was a big advantage in Japan. The Xperia range from Sony (NYSE:SNE) had set the mark for this and it was important for Apple to follow.

Late last year Apple introduced mobile billing in Japan with carrier KDDI. This should further boost the company in what is the world's biggest mobile gaming market. KDDI has over 46 million subscribers. Apple is expected to finalise deals with other carriers shortly.

Gaming is a target market for Apple in Japan. In December the company introduced a new exclusive game for iPhones and iPads, "Super Mario Run" from Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY). The best-selling Nintendo game "Pokemon Go" works on the Apple Watch as well as its other devices.

Apple also recently improved its Apple Pay mobile proximity reach in the country. While Apple is working with Nintendo on gaming, it is working with Sony on mobile payments, using its "Felicia" technology. Apple Pay has been integrated with the well-established Osaifu Keitai mobile wallet system. To do this, Apple had to fine-tune the mechanics of the phone itself to work with the relevant near-field communications system. It is believed this is the first time Apple has specifically tailor-made a phone for a specific market. This just emphasizes the importance of the Japanese market to Apple.

Apple Pay could be a big winner for Apple in the country. Mobile payments are used everywhere in the extensive public transportation system around Japan. This encompasses 4710 railway stations and 30,000 buses, as well at the country's airports and taxis. 57 million cards for transportation purposes are in usage. It is extended to the country's approximately 350,000 convenience stores.

This will further cement Apple's dominating presence around the country even if the revenue generated is not that meaningful. It is expected that further Apple stores will be rolled out, to add to the existing 13 stores.

In signs of the growing involvement with Japan, the company will be opening an AI development site in Yokohama in March, pictured below:

Cook has cited this as the beginning of forging new partnerships in the country and probably sourcing components for future products.

The Rest of Asia

Apple Pay, which I focused on in a previous article, is a pull factor for Apple in Asia. It may not be a big total revenue generator. It will, however, add substantially to the stickiness of the Apple ecosystem in a continent where mobile payment is very popular. Of the 14 international markets in which Apple Pay is available, 7 are in Asia/Australasia. These are in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. At the results briefing, Cook stated that Apple Pay had increased 500% year-on-year, albeit presumably from a fairly low base. Developments in Japan highlight this potential.

Apple HomeKit, which I wrote about some months ago, should also have more impact in Asia than elsewhere. Smart home ideas are the topic of much Government-driven encouragement. This is particularly the case as Governments in Asia worry about pollution in big cities and labour market tightness.

The Apple Watch is said to have had its best quarter yet in the one just gone, according to Canalys. 6 million watches are estimated to have been shipped. Apple does not break out the numbers, but it is likely that a substantial chunk of these were in China. Luxury editions of the Watch have been rolled out in the country. These include special editions for Chinese New Year and the Hermes model which retails at up to US$1499. The much-reported fact that Swiss watch sales have declined in Asia in the past two years is directly connected to the rise in sales of the Apple Watch.

In a policy Cook is rolling out in several Asian countries, it is reported that Apple is planning a research center in Jakarta, the capital of the Indonesian nation of 250 million people. This is likely to be in conjunction with Foxconn, with whom Apple is working closely in various Asian countries.

Apple is said to have committed US$44 million over 3 years to this Indonesian center. This may not be unconnected to the fact that regulations now state a necessity for local content in smartphones to sell them there. This investment counts as such local content. The market leaders in Indonesia are Samsung and Oppo. They both have manufacturing facilities in the country.

In Singapore, recent figures from IDC show that Apple is the market leader. Despite being a small country, 3.4 million smartphones shipped to Singapore last year. Apple enjoyed 46% market share. The other Top Five vendors were Samsung, Asus, Sony and LG.

2017 should be strong for Apple in Singapore. There is the opening of the first official Apple store and the next iPhone model expected in the third quarter. The country is an example, similar to Japan, of how the company can be the biggest smartphone provider in Asian countries despite those who say its cost is too high.

The graphic below illustrates Apple's supplier network in Asia:

Despite all the talk from Trump about bringing manufacturing jobs back to the USA, this is the reality. Apple looks to be concentrating its resources increasingly not just on manufacturing in Asia but also on data and development centers and retail outlets.

Conclusion

The figures for Asia will look even better when currency fluctuations improve in Apple's favor, which at some stage they surely will.

Economies in the region will continue to grow faster than elsewhere in the world. According to forecasts from the Asian Development Bank for 2017, growth will be as follows:

China +6.4%

East Asia +5.7%

South Asia +7.3%

S-E Asia +4.6%

Much of this growth will come from domestic demand tied to young growing populations. This is perfect for enticing demand for products such as those of Apple.

In the meantime, Apple will be continuing its investments in the region. There will be investments in manufacturing, in data centers and research centers, and in retail bricks and mortar. These should all translate to increased penetration in Asian markets and an increasing share of Apple's revenues coming from Asia.

The kind of market penetration achieved in Japan can be replicated in many other markets in Asia. This represents growth opportunities not available to Apple in other regions of the world.

Apple's growing Services segments are especially well suited to Asia. These include Apple Pay, Health Kit, Music, Home Kit and Gaming. Services revenues and products, as well as iPhone sales, should contribute strongly to Apple's growth prospects in the region. Combined with a new form iPhone 8, this can represent the perfect storm for the company.

Apple sends warning to banks with Australian mobile payments decision Regulators in Australia handed Apple a big win in the mobile payment market Friday, 31 Mar 2017 | 8:58 AM ET | 00:50

Apple Inc on Friday won a victory in its global fight to prevent banks from introducing their own mobile payment services on Apple devices, as an Australian regulator barred lenders from bargaining collectively for access.



The decision by Australia's competition watchdog, the first of its kind, will stop the banks from introducing their own mobile applications on iPhones and Apple Watches that could be used for contactless payments instead of the Apple Wallet.

The banks had hoped to circumvent transaction fees and get customers to engage more frequently with their own apps, potentially unlocking more of Australia's contactless payment market valued at an estimated $84 billion a year.

"It will have global implications," Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman (ACCC) Rod Sims told Reuters after the ruling came down.

"If others need to think it through ... weve at least got something out there which they can kick off from."

A win by four of the largest Australian banks involved in the case, which command two-thirds of the nation's credit card market, would have given them more negotiating power and could have sparked similar appeals to regulators for access to Apple's systems in other jurisdictions around the world.

Apple does not allow any of its 3,500 bank partners in 15 global markets access to the near-field communication (NFC) technology behind its payment system.

The Australian regulator was concerned that giving the banks bargaining power could reduce competition by forcing Apple to act more like Alphabet Inc, whose Google arm owns the more open Android operating system that allows contactless payments from individual apps.

"(Apple and Android) are very different offerings and they have different implications for ease of use, security and customer experience," Sims said.

"It is a tricky issue for a competition regulator to force one competitor to adopt a strategy of the other competitor." Why Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Is A Must Buy? Hopes are high that shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are set to appreciate even more. Even after the stock of the Cupertino, California-based tech giant opened at a record high, some analysts are optimistic that substantial upside potential still remains.

Steven Milunovich, an analyst at UBS, estimates that the share price of Apple could rise to $200 in the next couple of years. This will be driven largely by new products such as the iPhone 8 which Milunovich expects to be a major upgrade and will thus force hordes of customers to buy it. The UBS analysts also expects other Apple products such as AirPods and the Apple Watch to continue exhibiting decent growth.

More to come

In an interview with CNBC, another analyst, Gene Munster, also expressed optimism that shares of Apple were yet to hit their optimal level.

 Our range is $180 to $200,  Munster said before adding that it will be easy for Apple to continue reporting revenue growth in the next couple of quarters because of lackluster results in the recent past.

Munster who works at Loup Ventures advised that it was an opportune time to purchase Apple shares because there was a lot of enthusiasm over the iPhone and then sell after the much-speculated-about smartphone has been released.

On course for the $1 trillion mark

Since May last year, Apple s stock has been on a recovery path having fallen to $90 at one point. Having appreciated by almost 60% since that low, the market capitalization of the world s most valuable company is now over $750 billion. Unless there will be buybacks, if the stock hits the anticipated price of $200, the market capitalization of Apple will exceed $1 trillion.

Yet another analyst who concurs that Apple s upside potential still remains is Drexel Hamilton s Brian White who has a buy rating on Apple and has set $185 as the price target. White suggested that Samsung s missteps have been to Apple s advantage and pointed out that the stock of the iPhone maker was one of the world s most underappreciated.

On Wednesday shares of Apple Inc edged up by 0.22% to close the day at $144.12.

https://www.journaltranscript.com/disclaimer Apple Inc. Stock Price Target Upped... Just In Case iPhone 8 Outsells iPhone 6 Apple stock is still hovering near its all-time high as another analyst has boosted his price target yet again because of the iPhone 8. A day doesn t go by without another new analyst report pushing expectations for the tenth anniversary model up even further. You d think one of these days we d reach a point where they couldn t raise their targets for Apple stock any further, but then again, perhaps not.

And that s why it seems Wall Street s fanaticism over the iPhone 8 is worse than it was for the iPhone 6 a few years ago.

The iPhone will be the next iPhone 6

This time it s Canaccord Genuity T. Michael Walkley who raised his price target for Apple stock, bumping it up by $11 to $165 per share and reiterating his Buy rating. He predicts that the company will sell 246 million iPhone units in fiscal 2018, which would be more than the 231 million units it sold during the iPhone 6 cycle.

Walkley believes that the iPhone 7 Plus enabled the company to extend its share of the premium end of the smartphone market last year, especially because of the Galaxy Note 7 recall. He thinks that these two factors combined to push the installed base of iPhones past 570 million as of the end of last year, which in turn helped the company enjoy record services revenue during the December quarter.

Apple stock riding on  iPhone the great 

Samsung finally revealed the Galaxy S8 earlier this week, but unsurprisingly, Apple stock bulls don t see anything that might threaten the iPhone. Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White even went so far as to grant a new name to the iPhone 8:  iPhone the great. 

He doesn t think the S8 or its larger sibling the Galaxy S8+ will be enough to offset the damage that was done to Samsung from the recall of the Note 7 or the enthusiasm around the iPhone 8 (Is anyone as excited about it as Wall Street analysts are? Starting to think all that enthusiasm is coming from hype created by analysts trying to convince investors to buy Apple stock.) And even though the stock is still around its all-time high, White feels it is  among the most underappreciated stocks in the world. 

In the Galaxy S8 and S8+, Samsung narrowed the bezel to make the display s viewing area bigger, and White said this is the same thing he expects the iPhone 8 to do. The Korean firm also used glass on both the front and back of both phones, another feature he expects from this year s tenth anniversary iPhone.

Some do have concerns about Apple stock

Even though most analysts have been gushing non-stop about the iPhone 8 and its implications for Apple stock, we do find someone with some concerns every so often. InvestorPlace contributor Vince Martin hit on perhaps the single biggest problem for it right now, which is all this  iPhone the great  commentary.

While Martin does describe the iPhone as  the most successful consumer product of all time,  especially given that it has been successful enough to carry Apple from the brink of bankruptcy two decades ago to its position as the most valuable company in the world. The problem is that the company doesn t really have any other big products. In fact, most of the time Apple stock has been struggling was at times when investors were questioning whether the rest of the company can grow. Indeed, if the iPhone ever stops growing, it won t look good for Apple. After all, the iPad was a blockbuster in the early years, but sales are falling. Sales of the Apple Watch   which every analyst was convinced would be the  next big thing  aren t even enough to be broken out of the  other  revenue category (What happens if analysts are wrong about the iPhone 8 too?).

Martin notes that non-iPhone revenue hasn t grown much at all over the last five years, as it stood at $77.8 billion in 2012, rose to $80.6 billion in 2014, but then pulled back in 2015 and didn t top $79 billion again in 2016.

Services and ETFs

He s also skeptical about whether the company s services business will turn out to be as great as it would have investors believe because of concerns about competition from Netflix, Pandora Media and a wide array of others. He doesn t feel that the services business has been the answer of what comes next after the iPhone.

He also notes that exchange-traded funds have had an impact on Apple stock this year because the company is so massive that any change in its stock moves the indices. He describes major tech-focused ETFs as having  almost comically overweight positions in Apple  stock, such as the iShares U.S. Technology ETF, which has Apple weighted at greater than 16%. He argues that ETF buying has helped along this year s gains in Apple stock

Apple: A Power In Streaming Music

Source: Mac Rumors

Cary Sherman, Chairman and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), authored a blog post today in which he celebrated a turning point in the US music business. Retail revenue in 2016 grew by 11.5% y/y to $7.7 billion, and it did so largely because of the burgeoning popularity of music streaming services such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music and Spotify (Private:MUSIC). Revenue from streaming now accounts for more than 51% of revenue, with physical media and digital downloads continuing to decline.

Source: RIAA

Sherman also paid a complement of sorts to Apple and Spotify for their artist compensation, while taking a swipe at Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) YouTube.

Sherman wrote:

The unfortunate reality is that we have achieved this modest success in spite of our current music licensing and copyright laws, not because of them. That's not the way it should be. For example, it makes no sense that it takes a thousand on-demand streams of a song for creators to earn $1 on YouTube, while services like Apple and Spotify pay creators $7 or more for those same streams. Why does this happen? Because a platform like YouTube wrongly exploits legal loopholes to pay creators at rates well below the true value of music while other digital services - including many new and small innovators - cannot. It may be the same song requested by the user, on the same device, but the payouts differ enormously because of an unfair and out-of-date legal regime.

Sherman points out that revenue is still half of what it was in 1999:

Clearly, the music industry has been hurt by the ability to create unlimited digital copies of CDs, as well as loose DRM controls for downloadable music. Subscription streaming music services such as Apple's appear to be the perfect solution to the problem. The ubiquity of the service minimizes the temptation to make unauthorized copies, and the central nature of the service allows for accurate tabulation of song streams so that artists can be appropriately compensated.

Apple's acquisition of Beats and the subsequent creation of Apple Music in 2015 appears to have been very well timed. By the end of last year, Apple had 20 million subscribers, still about half of Spotify, but very good growth for the new service. Between them, it's been estimated that they generate about $7 billion in revenue per year, assuming a subscription price of $10/month.

In an interview with Billboard last December, Eddie Cue, head of Internet Software and Services said:

It's been quite a year. We were thrilled to see that we could take [artists'] passions and drive them all the way to No. 1. Chance the Rapper, who we put on Apple Music exclusively, hit the top 10 on the Billboard charts [based on streams alone], and I can't recall that being done before.

Cue also pointed out the huge opportunity that Apple still has before it:

We can't forget that, as an industry, we still have very few music subscribers. There are billions of people listening to music and we haven't even hit 100 million subscribers. There's a lot of growth opportunity.

Indeed there is. With a billion or more Apple devices in the world, Apple Music can grow considerably even within its own ecosystem of devices. And Apple isn't limited to its own devices, since there's an Apple Music app for Android.

Rethink Technology recommends Apple as a buy.

BlackBerry Reports Earnings Tomorrow

BlackBerry (NASDAQ:BBRY) will report earnings before market open tomorrow morning. BlackBerry continues to transition to a software company specializing in mobile device management software and services for enterprise. According to the Wall Street Journal, analysts expect BlackBerry's total revenue to decline by 37% y/y to $289 million, with approximately $0.0 EPS.

Software and Services revenue is expected to grow, but hardware revenue will continue to decline. As BlackBerry disengages from hardware manufacturing, its revenue from BlackBerry branded handset sales is expected to be from licensing royalties for its brand and the security software it provides.

BlackBerry's QNX business is considered another bright spot since QNX software is embedded in more than 60 million vehicles. BlackBerry has targeted IoT and Advanced Driver Assistance for QNX-related growth.

Ryzen 7 Optimization for Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation

Following the initial disappointing game performance of Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ:AMD) Ryzen 7 CPUs, it was assumed that game developers needed to perform some "optimization" to better accommodate AMD's multi-threading approach. The developers of Ashes of the Singularity, not surprisingly, have now offered just such an optimization for AotS: Escalation, and this has been tested by Tom's Hardware.

Tom's did find that in the "CPU test," the optimization provided a 16.3% boost in average frame rate for the 8 core Ryzen 7 1800X. This was just enough to edge out the 4 core Kaby Lake Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) Core i7-7700K.

The value proposition of the 1800X is still somewhat questionable for most consumer and gaming use. The 1800X at $500 barely edges out the i7-7700K at $350. This isn't so much about AMD or Ryzen architecture as it is about the value of an 8 core/16 thread processor, which many have questioned for home use even in Intel form.

Nevertheless, the performance improvement will undoubtedly embolden AMD fans as they await Ryzen 5 and 3.

WCCFTech had some interesting observations on the results:

It does raise some interesting questions though. If optimization is necessary on a title to achieve Intel-like performance for Ryzen processors then it means that the underlying problem isn't being solved but is rather being worked around. This would further imply that the problem isn't something which can be fixed with a magical software patch but rather something that has to do with how AMD has implemented SMT in their new architecture.

Tom's indicated that the patch was a fairly small download, so it might well qualify as "magical." However, there is still the question of whether most game developers will go to the trouble of optimization. If the size of the patch is any indication of the level of effort, then they probably will.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) and Lululemon Athletica inc. (NASDAQ:LULU) are experiencing opposite fates in the stock-verse this week, with Apple hype speeding down the tracks toward the keyed up iPhone X launch this fall while Lululemon careens from same store sale pressures that led investors scurrying away. Analysts alter price targets in reverse directions, from Raymond James excited on Apple even amid escalating DRAM and NAND costs to a far more cautious FBR who questions what lies in store for Lululemon s long-term prospects. Let s take a closer look:

Apple Upgrades on the Back Burner Until iPhone 8

Apple build up for the iPhone X continues to escalate, and Raymond James analyst Tavis McCourt joins in the bullish conversation as all survey signs point to big iPhone purchases ahead. In reaction, the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on shares of AAPL while lifting the price target from $152 to $159, which represents a just under 11% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

McCourt notes consumers are  starting to pull back on purchases ahead of a much anticipated iPhone launch later this year,  prompting him to lift 2018 projections from $252.63 billion to $261.4 billion in revenue and from $10 to $10.24 for EPS. When polling 500 domestic smartphone users, customer retention rates proved most robust for iPhone owners, with Apple scoring a 93.7% retention rate compared to Android s 84.9% retention rate.

 The story becomes more interesting when considering the timing of respondents  intended upgrades. In our March survey, only 5.3% of iPhone owners we surveyed expect to purchase an iPhone in the next three months (the lowest in our survey s history), while 34.1%, a record high in our survey, intend to purchase on in the next 12 months (the highest in the survey s history.) This data is consistent with U.S. consumers being quite aware of a potentially major iPhone model coming out later this year, which has fewer willing to upgrade in the next few months, but a more than typical amount expecting to purchase on the next upgrade cycle. 

However, the analyst advises to keep a watchful eye out for memory chips, considering prices have been  volatile,  flashing  meaningfully  upward in costs in recent months. Yet, largely, this is not a surprise to the tech giant, and the analyst remains on the whole unfazed, concluding,  Apple indicated in its January conference call that it was assuming higher commodity costs, so we can assume at least some of this added cost burden is already baked into the March gross margin guidance. 

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, four-star analyst Tavis McCourt is ranked #500 out of 4,558 analysts. McCourt has a 63% success rate and realizes 8.4% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, McCourt yields 31.8% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics exhibit AAPL as a Buy. Out of 37 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 29 are bullish on Apple stock, 6 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 7%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $153.69.

Lulu: Will the Power of the Brand Be Enough to Outlast the Competition?

Lulu shares deflated 23% yesterday after the athletic apparel giant stumbled on sluggish same-store sales (SSS) in its fourth quarter performance for 2016. Though FBR analyst Susan Anderson recognizes Lululemon has taken proactive steps to address its SSS setback, the analyst remains wary on the giant s future in face of a rival-rising atmosphere.

Therefore, the analyst reiterates a Market Perform rating on LULU while reducing the price target from $67 to $59, which represents a just under 11% increase from where the shares last closed.

For the fourth quarter, LULU posted adjusted EPS of $1.00 (not withstanding a 1 cent tax impact), compared to the analyst s and consensus forecasts of $1.01 as well as guided EPS between $0.99 and $1.01. From the analyst s perspective, this mirrors a 7% rise in constant-currency comps, higher than what she anticipated at 6% as well as consensus who called for 5.4%. LULU management guides the first quarter of2017 to $0.25 to $0.27 in EPS, lower than the analyst s expectations looking for $0.34 and consensus of $0.39. Additionally, LULU sets 2017 guidance between $2.26 and $2.36, under the analyst s $2.40 projection and consensus of $2.57.

On the bright side, the giant is taking  initiatives to improve sales,  explains the analyst, noting,  LULU has many ecommerce initiatives to drive improved sales as consumers move online, including a new mobile app to launch in 2Q17 and upgrade of ship from store in 2Q17. Additionally, LULU has a number of strategic sales investments that will ramp up in 2017, including new product introductions with more depth/color (flowing in now and more so in 2Q17) and better online merchandising, new outerwear styles in 2H17, a new brand campaign in 2Q17, and a new CRM system. 

Overall,  Management noted that 1Q SSS got off to a tough start as ecommerce conversions slowed at the end of January and continued to be soft 1QTD (management believes product was too dark), and mall traffic weakened in Feb which impacted store sales. We believe an improvement is expected in April given the shifts, which is likely factored into guidance. While we believe LULU has a strong brand, we are concerned the environment has become more competitive and it will be tough for LULU to return to +MSD comps to execute its margin strategy and maintain our Market Perform rating,  Anderson concludes, questionable that the giant s margin profile can be  achievable longer term. 

As usual, we like to include the analyst s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, three-star analyst Susan Anderson is ranked #2,246 out of 4,558 analysts. Anderson has a 52% success rate and earns 1.0% in her yearly returns. However, when recommending LULU, Anderson loses 14.9% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics show LULU as a Hold. Based on 21 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 8 rate a Buy on Lulu stock, 10 maintain a Hold, while 3 issue a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $63.08, marking a 24% upside from where the stock is currently trading. Apple fixes 911 cyberattack flaw in latest iOS update Among the changes in an iPhone software update Apple Inc. released this week: a fix aimed at preventing cyberattacks on 911 centers in the U.S.

The vulnerability was exposed in October after an 18-year-old in Arizona allegedly designed code that would cause iPhones to repeatedly dial 911. A link to the code went viral on Twitter, as teenagers began sharing it as a prank.

Read: The night zombie smartphones took down 911

The incident, which was detailed in a Wall Street Journal article, resulted in thousands of accidental 911 calls, overwhelming operators in at least a dozen states across the U.S.

The 18-year-old accused of writing the code, Meetkumar Desai, was arrested last fall and charged with four felony counts of computer tampering. His lawyer didn t respond to a request for comment Thursday.

Read: Android projected to top Apple in app revenue for first time this year

The code only triggered 911 calls from iPhones, exploiting a feature in the smartphone s software that allows users to click on a phone number and immediately initiate a call. Apple AAPL, -0.14% says the update supersedes that capability and now requires users to always press a second confirmation before initiating a call.

Apple says it initially worked with app developers to fix the vulnerability, and this update will now prevent it from happening even on apps that hadn t already fixed the issue.

Mike Flynn Offers to Testify in Exchange for Immunity

With Washington s Blessing, Telecom Giants Can Mine Your Web History Slowing iPhone sales blamed for Foxconn's first ever sales decline Bernstein analyst: iPhone 8 cycle will be significant, upward revisions likely Tuesday, 21 Mar 2017 | 12:23 PM ET | 04:46

Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and a key Apple Inc supplier, on Friday reported 30 percent growth in fourth quarter net profit from a year ago, defying expectations for a decline.

That profit gain came despite revenue falling last year by 2.8 percent, the first decline since the company listed shares on the Taiwan Stock Exchange in 1991, according to company information.

The profit was likely to have been boosted by solid bookings for Apple's bigger-sized iPhone 7 models, which Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co assembles, analysts said.

Net profit in the final three months of 2016 ended four quarters of year-on-year declines to reach T$68.77 billion ($2.26 billion), up from T$52.93 billion in the fourth quarter of 2015, according to a Reuters calculation based on Foxconn's full year 2016 results.

It was well ahead of the T$48.78 billion forecast by analysts polled by Reuters and double the T$34.64 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2016.

For 2016 as a whole, Foxconn's net profit totalled T$148.7 billion, up 1.2 percent from 2015, the company said in a filing to the Taiwan Stock Exchange on Friday.

Foxconn did not break out its fourth quarter figures and did not elaborate on its results.

Analysts see a brighter year for Foxconn in 2017, following a turnaround at its majority-owned Sharp Corp, more orders expected for the bigger-sized iPhone 7 models, and the expected launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone later this year.

Foxconn's quarterly net profits had been expected to grow again year-on-year from the first quarter of this year, analysts said.

The outlook comes as Foxconn is looking at Toshiba Corp's chip business, as potentially its next big purchase after taking a majority stake in Sharp last year.

Last month, Japanese display maker Sharp lifted its full-year profit guidance after posting its first quarterly net profit in more than two years. Analyst: Apple Investors Should Heed These Major Warning Signs From Tony Sagami : Every one of my four children has an iPhone, but I m a committed android (Samsung Galaxy) user.

Why? Mainly because my aging eyes prefer a bigger screen and because I m too cheap to pay the premium prices that iPhones command.

The iPhone fans turned out in droves last week when Apple opened three new retail stores: Miami, Florida; Cologne Germany; and Nanjing, China.

Apple store openings have turned into big media events with thousands of customers eagerly waiting in line to be a part of the excitement. In China, customers started queuing on Thursday, two days BEFORE the Saturday opening.

Apple understands the gigantic opportunity in China. In 2016, it sold a whopping 476 million smartphones in China. To put that 476 million in perspective, it is 2.86 times the Apple phones sold in the U.S. market.

Moreover, the size of the smartphone market in China is huge   33% of the world s total sales   and it grew by 11.4% in 2016.

No wonder Apple is aggressively expanding into China. The new Nanjing store stands as its 41st foothold in the Land of the Red Dragon.

However, all those Apple stores aren t translating into booming sales.

Apple sold 18% fewer iPhones in China in 2016   43.77 million   than it did in 2015. And it saw market share slide to less than 10%, making it only the fifth-largest mobile-phone seller in China.

Yes fifth place! After 

1st Place : Hauwei, which sold 2.02 million units in January alone and which has an impressive 23% of the Chinese market.

: Hauwei, which sold 2.02 million units in January alone and which has an impressive 23% of the Chinese market. 2nd Place : Oppo.

: Oppo. 3rd Place : Vivo.

: Vivo. 4th Place: Xiaomi.

Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi have a combined market share of 55.5%.

The reasons for Apple s struggle are simple: China is full of cost-conscious consumers, like me, and all of the above four companies offer substantially cheaper smartphones.

In general terms, Chinese smartphones offer approximately the same level of technology and features for half the price of an iPhone.

Yup   half the price.

My point is that Apple is doing very poorly in the largest, most-important smartphone market in the world. And that has some serious long-term implications for Apple investors.

If you own Apple shares, you should consider the following:

Trouble Sign #1: Apple shares have appreciated by more than 30% (market cap gain of $150 billion!) since Samsung s phones started catching on fire. Samsung s global sales fell from 83.8 million to 72.5 million in the last year. But Samsung will return to recover some of its lost market share and that is going to put even more pressure on Apple.

Trouble Sign #2: Apple is spending about $6 billion a quarter to buy back its stock. Hey, there s nothing fundamentally wrong with stock buybacks. Heck, I think they re great! However, a thriving tech innovator grows its profits through rising sales, not a falling share count.

Trouble Sign #3: The once red-hot iPad isn t so hot anymore. Sales of iPad fell to 13.1 million in the fourth quarter from 16.1 million during the same period a year earlier, an 18.6% decline.

Moreover, sales are so bad that Apple chopped prices in desperation to goose sales.

Trouble Sign #4: Did you know that Al Gore sits on the Apple board of directors? And did you know that Gore sold $29 million worth of his Apple stock in February?

I m not talking about an inconsequential number of shares, either. Gore sold 215,437 shares and now owns 230,137 shares, which means that he sold almost 50% of what he owned. Whenever an insider dumps half of his stock   pay attention!

Trouble Sign #5: $5 billion for headquarters   really? Apple will soon open its new 2.8 million-square-foot, ring-shaped headquarters. I m sure the millennials will love this new high-tech campus   but come on! $5 billion for a building?!

Trouble Sign #6: Over the past 12 months, Apple reported per-share-earnings of $8.35, which means that it is now selling for 17-times earnings. That may not sound expensive, but it is the most richly valued that Apple has been in the last five years.

If you are an Apple investor, I m not suggesting that you rush out and sell all your Apple shares tomorrow morning. What I am saying is that Apple isn t the red-hot growth stock that it used to be and that smart investors should have a strategy to protect their gains if more signs of trouble continue to pop up.

The mobile, smartphone market isn t dead. Quite the contrary; it is going to explode, but Apple is far from the best way to invest in it.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell $0.4 (-0.28%) in premarket trading Friday. Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 24.27%, versus a 5.71% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Google as a brand name has now become so associated with search engines that it has become a verb which is used in reference to searching online. This has helped the company continually rake in billions of dollars in revenues from search advertising.

Google s rise in the rankings was a blow to Apple which had been at the top of the list for the last half a decade. Apple s brand name is now valued at $107 billion having declined from its value of $146 billion in 2016. According to Brand Finance, some of the reasons that have contributed to Apple s poor performance include some missteps the iPhone maker has taken such as merely making minor tweaks in old products and offering them as new versions instead of providing truly revolutionary products.

Amazon is coming

Coming hot on the heels of Apple was Amazon with a brand value of $106 billion having registered a dramatic increase in value of about 53%. And as the ecommerce giant diversifies, innovates and makes acquisitions, it could become a major contender for the top position in the coming years.

This year saw an 11% increase in the combined brand value of the 500 U.S. brands that are ranked at the top as they are now valued at over $3 trillion.

On Thursday shares of Alphabet Inc fell marginally by 0.05% to close the day at $849.48.

Apple, Inc. Brings Its Fight With Qualcomm to China Earlier this month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) filed a blockbuster lawsuit against its most important supplier, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), alleging a wide range of transgressions that were all intended to enhance Qualcomm's monopoly power over the baseband processor market. That suit came just days after the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a similar regulatory antitrust complaint against the mobile chip giant.

Apple isn't stopping there; the Mac maker is now taking its grievances to the Middle Kingdom.

There's more where that came from

Apple has filed not one, but two suits against Qualcomm in Beijing, Reuters reports. The first is seeking 1 billion yuan (approximately $145 million) in damages, accusing Qualcomm of abusing its monopoly power in the baseband market. The second alleges that Qualcomm has not fulfilled its obligations to license its standards-essential patents under fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) levels.

The fact that Apple is suing Qualcomm in China is notable for a few reasons, the most obvious being that the scope of Apple's complaints reaches beyond just the U.S. itself. Apple's lawsuit in the U.S. was filed in the U.S. District Court of Southern California. China also doesn't have a particularly good reputation for enforcing intellectual property (IP) laws, although the country has been making progress on improving its legal frameworks. The discrepancy in IP enforcement is one reason why many Chinese smartphone manufacturers, most notably Xiaomi, are unable to expand operations into countries with stricter enforcement.

China is also where the vast majority of Apple's contract manufacturers are located, including its most prolific iPhone assembler, Foxconn. These contract manufacturers are partially responsible for Apple's predicament with Qualcomm. As noted in Apple's U.S. complaint, Qualcomm refuses to license its IP directly to Apple, instead preferring to ink deals with Apple contract manufacturers that pass along both the IP rights indirectly as well as the royalty costs in full. Apple's manufacturing partners simply accept Qualcomm's terms and do not negotiate, leaving Apple with massive royalty bills.

Apple has long attempted to review the agreements between Qualcomm and its contract manufacturers, but Qualcomm must consent -- and it won't. I'm neither an American or Chinese lawyer, but it seems possible that Apple is seeking legal assistance in China so that it may gain access or somehow restructure these agreements, although legal discovery in China is significantly more restricted than here in the U.S. Even if that's not the goal, it wouldn't hurt to collect more in monetary damages by filing suit in multiple relevant jurisdictions, as Apple says it's been overcharged by billions of dollars over the past five years.

This serves as additional evidence that Apple has absolutely no intention of settling with Qualcomm. The company feels as if it has been wronged all these years, being coerced into quietly overpaying Qualcomm for half a decade. And now that Qualcomm's exclusivity has ended, the time for reckoning has come. Has Apple Pulled Off A Deal To Manufacture In India? The Wall Street Journal is reporting this morning that Apple is close to reaching an agreement with Indian government officials to set up a manufacturing plant in India to manufacture its products locally.

Indian officials met with a team from Apple in New Delhi earlier in the day (Indian time) to discuss the company's requests and look over the proposal.

The Wall Street Journal said, quoting an official with knowledge of the negotiations, "It's almost a done deal."

"Many of the incentives sought by Apple are workable," added the official.

If the deal is done, India could quickly become one of Apple's most important markets going forward. Apple currently has a 5% share of the smartphone market in India but one that is growing at a very rapid clip. With products produced locally, Apple could increase mindshare and market share at an even faster pace thus making serious inroads into a country that has one of the largest and fastest growing middle class globally.

Market research firms say that India will soon overtake the U.S. as the second largest smartphone market in the world behind only China. India is a crucial market for Apple's long term success.

It's not just Apple manufacturing locally that is at stake here. It's also Apple's plan to set up a direct retail footprint in India, and locally manufactured products will go a long way in helping Apple achieve that goal. In addition, Apple could also slowly begin to replace China as a manufacturing hub due to the rapidly increasing costs of production in China relative to India.

Like I have said, does one buy/add Apple at current levels or does one do it at higher levels from here?

Words to the wise.

Apple, Inc.'s First 2 Original TV Shows Are Almost Here Investors have known for quite some time that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is pushing into original content, primarily as a way to differentiate its Apple Music service from rival music streamers. Apple has been investing in a handful of new TV shows that will be exclusive to Apple Music, and the first two are almost here.

The first is a reality TV series that focuses on apps and app developers, called Planet of the Apps. Celebrity advisors Jessica Alba, Gwyneth Paltrow, Gary Vaynerchuk, and will.i.am will offer to guide new developers in an effort to win funding from prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, which incidentally is about to make a fortune on an app it funded years ago: Snap.

Apple started casting for the show last summer, which is kind of like The Voice mixed with Shark Tank but for apps. Speaking at the Code Media conference last night, Apple services chief Eddy Cue said the show would debut in the spring on Apple Music as well as through a dedicated app. Episodes will be released in a linear fashion, one at a time (sorry, binge watchers).

The second is Carpool Karaoke, which is based on the popular segment of the same name from The Late Late Show with James Corden. This one was already publicized, as no one can forget CEO Tim Cook singing "Sweet Home Alabama" at WWDC last year before confirming that the series was coming to Apple Music. The show will feature 16 celebrity hosts, and will likewise be released weekly instead of all at once.

Personally, neither show looks particularly compelling to me. But that's precisely the challenge that Apple now faces.

If the strategy fails, it will fail (relatively) cheaply

Given the extremely diverse spectrum of consumer preferences when it comes to video content, Apple will need to create content across a wide range of genres that appeal to a wide range of consumers if the company truly wants to position original content as a differentiator and selling feature in a meaningful way. As Apple Music expands around the world, Apple will also need to localize content and cater to local preferences in geographical regions all around the world.

That's expensive, and a tough balance even for pure-play media companies that specialize in and have deep experience with content. Apple has neither, even if it has deep pockets. Furthermore, the company has made it quite clear that it its content strategy is intended to bolster Apple Music, and has no intention to launch a stand-alone video streaming service (although not for a lack of trying). Besides, who subscribes to a music service specifically in order to get video content?

However, there is some potential for Planet of the Apps to inspire a new generation of developers, which would be a secondary benefit. Apple relies heavily on its army of third-party developers to keep its digital repositories flush with app content, and culturally reinforcing its pipeline of developers is a good thing. The show may serve in part as a giant episodic marketing campaign to come develop for iOS.

This is likely just the beginning for Apple, and presumably the company will diversify its content strategy further going forward. Fortunately for investors, the risks are fairly modest for a company of this size. While shows are expensive -- a season can easily cost tens of millions of dollars -- they're much less than if Apple were to pursue some sort of theoretical blockbuster acquisition around video streaming. On top of that, Apple Music's revenue run rate is in excess of $2.4 billion right now, based on the 20 million subscribers it disclosed in December.

I still think the original content strategy is misguided, but at least the financial risks are small if it fails. Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Really Worth $150? Goldman Sachs (ticker: GS) gave Apple Inc. ( AAPL) shareholders an early Valentine's Day present on Monday, raising its price target to from $133 to $150 per share. Naturally, AAPL stock responded well to the news; shares rose about 1 percent in response to the praise, hitting 52-week highs in the process.

The $150 level represents a 13.5 percent increase from Friday's closing price of $132.12.

The question is: How realistic is Goldman's $150 price target?

[Read: The 10 Most Anticipated IPOs of 2017.]

Don't count Apple out. Apple is coming off a blowout quarter, one that beat nearly all analyst expectations and sent AAPL stock skyrocketing. Shares jumped 6 percent following the fiscal first-quarter results.

A big part of what made Apple's first quarter numbers so good were the shockingly good iPhone sales numbers, which analysts expected to be very muted following a string of disappointing results in the quarters preceding it.

Point being: just when you count AAPL out, the company shows it still has a trick or two up its sleeve. And if Goldman's right, Apple's greatest tricks are yet to come.

Goldman's thesis. The bottom line is that Goldman expects big things from the iPhone, the 2007 invention that quickly became Apple's best-selling product, transformed the business, and turned it into the most valuable company in the world.

Last quarter alone, AAPL sold over $54 billion worth of iPhones, setting a company record and accounting for nearly 70 percent of Apple's overall sales.

But Goldman expects the iPhone 8 to be a major improvement from the iPhone 7, seeing as this will be the 10-year anniversary of the first model.

Apple has been roundly criticized for not making meaningful changes from one iPhone model to the next, but this time, the tech community will be expecting something big.

"The iPhone7 didn't offer the upgrade that many consumers were looking for, but the next model is rumored to be packed with several new features. I am not sure about $150 as Goldman Sachs suggests, but extending to $143, Bloomberg's 12-month consensus target price might not quite as far fetched," says Chris Kim, senior vice president and chief investment officer at Tompkins Financial Advisors, based in White Plains, New York.

Goldman specifically expects the iPhone 8 to come with a "3D sensing functionality" that would "enable a robust augmented reality feature set that we believe will be a key differentiator." Apple insiders have hinted before at AR and virtual reality would be major points of focus for AAPL going forward, and following the huge success of games like Pokemon Go in 2016, any iOS or phone manufacturer that makes AR easy to develop for and play with has the potential to be richly rewarded.

Not only that, but Goldman thinks the iPhone 8 will have an OLED display, allowing for the removal of the home button entirely. Some have suggested the iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone with the ability to charge wirelessly as well, would be a huge step forward.

"The phone is speculated to have some nice features that are more function than form, which tends to draw in more upgraders than normal," says Peter Karazeris, an analyst with Thrivent Financial in Minnesota.

Last and perhaps most importantly, Goldman expects the iPhone 8 to have three SKUs: the current 4.7" model, the current 5.5" model, and the yet-to-be-released 5.8" model.

The reason this additional 5.8" model would be so great for AAPL, as you might have guessed, is because it'd be more expensive than the other two, raising the average selling price for all iPhones sold and boosting the top line.

Currently the 4.7" model goes for $649 and the 5.5" model goes for $769, so seeing an average selling price at or near $800 a pop for the largest model seems quite reasonable.

But Goldman needs more than just chatter about the long-anticipated 10th iPhone anniversary to justify its $150 price target for AAPL stock.

The Wall Street bank does that by raising its projected iPhone sales for 2017 from 227.3 million phones to 230 million. For 2018, it increased its forecast from 231.5 million phones to 235.9 million.

[Read: 5 Reasons Donald Trump's Presidency Will Include a Recession.]

More importantly, Goldman is raising the earnings multiple it believes AAPL stock deserves from 14 to 16, making each dollar of earnings worth 14.3 percent more than it used to. Earnings multiples usually rise when greater growth is expected from a company in the coming years than there was previously, so a slight boost in Apple's multiple makes sense.

How Antifragile Is Apple Inc., Really? Earlier this month, an analyst for UBS made waves publishing a note about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Steve Milunovich asked: "Is Apple an anti-fragile monopoly?" He answers his own question, stating, "One characteristic of monopolies is pricing power. iPhone's ASP [average selling price] of almost $700 last quarter ... could further rise with the iPhone 8."

That note set off a wave of follow-up articles across the investing blogosphere about the anti-fragility of Apple. But what does "antifragile" mean, and why are so many investors making a fuss about it?

Antifragility: An introduction

Many people don't know what antifragile means, but it's a concept that I'm very familiar with. Indeed, it is the basis by which I make all of my investment decisions.

Antifragity is the product of thinker, trader, and author of Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder Nassim Taleb. He sees everything in the world as being classified in one of three ways: fragile, robust, and antifragile. While the first two are well-known concepts to most readers, the latter is new. Here's an easy way to think about it:

Fragile Robust Antifragile When stress is applied, it... Breaks Stays the same Gets stronger Example from real life A teacup falling from a table A piece of iron Human muscles after lifting a heavy weight What it likes A predictable sequence of events Doesn't care Small and non-fatal mistakes to learn from

Taleb uses the mythical Hydra -- pictured above -- as the ideal exemplar. If you cut the head off the beast, two more grow in its place. Indeed, it needs stress to grow stronger.

Sit back and ponder this classification long enough and you'll see the human body is the ultimate antifragile machine. If you don't apply acute stress intermittently, your body becomes weaker. That's why astronauts lose bone density: The lack of stress from the force of gravity weakens the bones.

It's important to note that there's a limit to antifragility. Apply too much stress -- or medium-level stress over a long enough time frame -- and something becomes fragile. They key here is that stressors are acute, not chronic, and there's time to rest and process after the stressors take place.

But what does this have to do with investing? I've broken it down to three critical variables.

The barbell approach

To become antifragile, Taleb suggests a barbell approach, which gives a visual. For our purposes, what this means is that a company should spend 85% of its time and effort securing safe and reliable income, while spending 15% of its time on high-risk, high-reward ventures.

I have come to view the "safe and reliable" as the company's moat, and "high-risk, high-reward" as optionality -- or the ability to test new ideas with limited downside but unlimited upside.

Apple's moat is composed of two parts: brand and high switching costs. As far as brand strength goes, Apple is second only to Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), according to Brand Finance, which says Apple's brand is worth $107 billion. That helps explain the phenomenon that Milunovich noted: Customers are willing to pay a premium for Apple products.

It should be noted, however, that this $107 billion represents a contraction of 26% over just one year. Brand Finance noted, "Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage and has repeatedly disillusioned its advocates with tweaks when material changes were expected."

That's where the weakness in Apple's moat shines through. The iPhone accounted for 63% of all sales last fiscal year. That's a heavy concentration in one area and represents the potential for fragility should the brand deteriorate.

The company's history shows continual development of new products: first the iPod, then the iPhone, followed by the iMac. All the while, Apple was developing the iTunes store and the iCloud. The iCloud has been paramount for ensuring that there are switching costs associated with abandoning Apple's ecosystem. The switching costs, however, are far from insurmountable.

And since the death of Steve Jobs, we've seen scant evidence of real optionality. While rumors have surfaced about Apple's move into cars, artificial intelligence, or other venues, the only real new product we've seen is the Apple Watch -- which hasn't demonstrably moved the company's long-term profit needle.

Perhaps most alarming was the company's change in mission statements under CEO Tim Cook. Under Jobs, Apple's mission was "To make a contribution to the world by making tools for the mind that advance humankind." That's a powerful mission that opens itself up for tons of optionality; there's no telling where "advancing humankind" can take you.

But the current version is a manifestation of business-speak that has almost no enduring meaning. It reads:

Apple designs Macs, the best personal computers in the world, along with OS X, iLife, iWork, and professional software. Apple leads the digital music revolution with its iPods and iTunes online store. Apple has reinvented the mobile phone with its revolutionary iPhone and App store, and is defining the future of mobile media and computing devices with iPad.

This is just plain awful. It gives me little confidence that the company will continue innovating the way it once did.

The brand is strong, but switching costs are weak, and it's tough to find evidence of real optionality under Cook.

Grade for Barbell Strategy = B-

Skin in the game

During antiquity, Taleb points out, managing risk was dealt with by ensuring that decision-makers had their skin in the game. The engineer who designed and built a bridge was forced to live underneath his bridge. It's a simple solution to a very complex problem of hidden or unknowable risk.

With Apple, there's very little skin in the game. Management altogether owns less than 1% of shares outstanding. While I can't necessarily blame Cook and company for this -- it's the largest company in the world, and few were there when it all started -- it doesn't change the fact that incentives aren't aligned as strongly as they are at a company like Alphabet.

On the other hand, I am encouraged by what employees seem to think of working at the company. Using Glassdoor.com, I see that Apple gets four out of five stars, with 79% who gave an opinion saying they'd recommend working there to a friend, and Cook getting a 94% approval rating. Those are all very high marks. I believe employees with such a high level of satisfaction are more likely to be open to learning from mistakes and pivoting their focus when the time calls for it -- the tenets of antifragility.

Grade for skin in the game = C+

Financial fortitude

Finally, we have a more traditional metric, the amount of cash a company has, how much it brings in on an annual basis, and how much debt it carries.

Debt is the ultimate bringer of fragility -- it reduces your options in times of stress and puts you at the whim of your debtors. Cash is the ultimate antifragile tool during a macro-financial crisis, as it gives you options: buying back shares on the cheap, outspending rivals to gain market share, or making acquisitions.

On all of these traits, Apple is very strong. It sports cash (including long- and short-term investments) of almost a quarter-trillion dollars -- against a debt load of "just" $73 billion. In addition, it brought in $54 billion in free cash flow and used less than 25% of it to pay its dividend.

Grade for financial fortitude = A+

So how Antifragile is Apple?

By my own scoring system, Apple is right in the middle of the pack. While the barbell strategy looms the largest, the company gets a grade of B. An "antifragile monopoly" it is not, but it's no slouch, either. That's why I've maintained my own skin in the game with the stock, as it accounts for 3% of my family's real-life holdings. Why the Apple Inc. A9 is Cheaper to Build than the A8X In a previous column, I offered up my thoughts on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest low-cost iPad (marketed simply as iPad). In a nutshell, Apple built a much more cost-effective version of its iPad Air 2 to allow it to attack the $329 price point, while at the same time keeping a reasonable margin structure.

In that article, discussing how Apple managed to cut costs in going from the iPad Air 2 to the new iPad, I made the following claim:

For example, it uses the A9 chip, which is certainly cheaper to produce than the A9X found in the iPad Pro and is almost certainly cheaper to produce than the older A8X found inside of the iPad Air 2.

The former statement (vis-a-vis the A9 and A9X) needs little justification, as the A9X is simply a more complex version of the A9. However, I feel that the comparison of the A9 and A8X cost structures is something that's probably worth justifying, and below, I intend to do just that.

Understanding what drives chip costs

In very basic terms, there are a few major factors that drive chip costs. The first is the cost of silicon wafers -- this largely depends on their manufacturing costs, and the profit margin that the contract chipmaker selling the wafers is hoping for. Typically, the more advanced a manufacturing technology, the more expensive the underlying silicon wafers are.

The next is chip size: All other things being equal, a larger chip is more expensive to build than a smaller chip. This is because in such a scenario, silicon-wafer size and cost are fixed, meaning that for a given wafer cost, a chipmaker can produce fewer total chips. Not only that, but yield rates of larger chips -- again, all else being equal -- are lower than yield rates of smaller chips (here's a discussion of the economics of silicon wafers).

Applying this to A8X vs. A9

The Apple A8X is manufactured using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company's (NYSE:TSM) 20-nanometer manufacturing technology. The A9 is sourced from both TSMC and Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) and is built using their respective 16-nanometer and 14-nanometer technologies.

The A8X chip measures in at 128 square millimeters; the Samsung-built A9 comes in at 96 square millimeters, and the TSMC-built A10 measures 104.5 square millimeters.

The 14/16-nanometer technologies upon which the A9 is built should be a bit more expensive than the one used to build the A8X (the "16-nanometer" technology used here can be thought of as simply a more advanced variant of the 20-nanometer, rather than an all-new technology), but the much larger die size of the A8X, relative to either A9, more than likely offsets the slight extra cost associated with the 14/16-nanometer technologies.

The A9 is cheaper and better

The nice thing about Apple's choice of the A9 for the low-cost iPad is that it's not only probably cheaper to manufacture than the A8X, but it's also a genuinely better processor. The A9 has faster processor cores than the A8X does (though the A9 has two and the A8X has three) and, per the 3DMark Ice Storm graphics performance test, a faster graphics processor than the A8X offers.

I believe that the performance and user experience that the new iPad should deliver with the A9 will be superior to what a hypothetical low-cost iPad with an A8X could have delivered.

Talk about a win-win! Apple's Augmented Reality Challenge Apple might need to go on an acquisition spree in order for the iPhone 8 to become a household Augmented Reality device.

The hard part will be to provide the information and services that can be incorporated in Augmented Reality applications.

Making the iPhone 8 the most advanced Augmented Reality device is simple, for it only requires better hardware sensors.

The latest buzz is that the upcoming iPhone 8 will have advanced Augmented Reality capabilities.

Augmented Reality (AG for short) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment, superimposing a computer-generated image on a user's view of the real world, thus providing a composite view in real time.

As per the latest buzz, the upcoming Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 8 will pack specialized software and hardware that will cater specifically to AG. While I think there is always a need for better hardware sensors, the devil as far as AR is concerned is the software. And that's where AAPL has to put its efforts.

In order for a smartphone to be able to play AR Apps, it has to have a minimum set of hardware.

GPS: AR Apps generally display results based on location parameters. Without location tracking tools, most AR apps don't function.

Compass (Magnetic Sensor): AR Apps also rely on direction based data. Without a Compass, an AR app cannot display information accurately.

Orientation Sensor (Gyroscope, Accelerometer): Most AR Apps need these sensors so Apps can determine how you are holding the device, and which way it is moving.

All iPhones have the above sensors. In addition, the iPhone 7 has the following sensors as well: Proximity sensor (his sensor can determine how close the iPhone is to your face), Ambient Light sensor, and moisture sensor.

While the 3 last sensors are not a prerequisite for AR Apps, they could nevertheless be incorporated if needed to enhance the AR experience.

So the iPhone for the most part is AR ready. In order for the iPhone 8 to pack additional specialized hardware crafted specifically for AR, I am guessing AAPL might incorporate additional sensors, or sensors like I described above, but more powerful.

In fact Reuters reported the iPhone might incorporate STMicroelectronics' (NYSE:STM) "time of flight" proximity sensors, that also measure range between a phone camera and objects in its view.

This type of sensor could act as an accurate rangefinder for the selfie camera. The advantage is that it doesn't depend on reflected light, instead it measures the time of travel of photons emitted from a laser diode, and this travel time is independent of the reflectance of the target surface.

In order for the iPhone 8 to be an overnight AR success, Apple must do two things:

1) The iPhone 8 must have default built-in AR capabilities

Apple has to come up with software that will bring out the AR capabilities of the iPhone out of the box. This means the iPhone must have general purpose AR Apps made by Apple.

The main reason for this is to enhance the ecosystem and make the iPhone the de-facto AR standard. If the iPhone were to be AR ready of the box, with Apps that are useful, this might be a reason for more people to prefer the iPhone over Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android OS.

So when the iPhone 8 comes out, I would like to see Siri be AR ready. I would like to point my iPhone 8 to an ancient building in the Athens Agora, and Siri telling me the history of what I am point to. Or I would like Siri to help me find an Indian restaurant when walking in Corso Venezia in Milan.

However many of these Apps already exist. Yelp (NYSE:YELP) Monocle has been around for several years, and is considered the first AR App for the iPhone. Monocle uses your smartphone's GPS and compass to display AR markers for nearby restaurants and bars in real time with ratings and reviews.

So can AAPL enhance Siri to be another Monocle? I honestly don't know, it will not be easy. The main challenge is that AAPL does not have the data to feed such an App.

Also, let's not forget Alphabet already has a head start with its AR translation capabilities, already built into Android. No App downloading required.

So AAPL has a lot of ground to cover, especially on the software front. Making the iPhone 8 more AR capable on the hardware side is the easy part, having content that people can use in a AR format will be the challenge.

2) Apple must use AR to procure service revenue

The second thing AAPL must do is to procure service revenue via AR. Be it in Navigation, Sightseeing, Medical, Gaming, Maintenance and Repair, or Entertainment, the AR space is going to be big business anyway you look at it.

So while enhancing the iPhone's 8 AR capabilities with advanced hardware sensors is great, at the end of the day AAPL does not do anything unless it sees $$ signs.

My guess is that AAPL is getting ready to go on a buying spree of companies, that are either already ahead in the AR space, or have the data and customers that can produce revenue using advanced AR services.

One example would be pointing your iPhone as walk down the street, and seeing what deals are available from different stores in real time. A consumer would then click on the deal, purchase a coupon with Apple Pay, and walk in the store and get the deal. APPL would make money from each transaction.

But how can AAPL do this? It cannot, because it's not in the deal business. However there are many other companies that are in the deal business. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) is one company that comes to mind.

Also, imagine if you are walking down 2nd Av in Manhattan, and you decide you want a pastrami sandwich. You simply flip out your iPhone, pluck in "pastrami sandwich", point to 2nd Av looking south, and your screen will tell you if there is a pastrami sandwich place anywhere.

Perhaps the store can offer a small discount if you purchased a sandwich via APPL's AR application, thus AAPL would get a small commission. Or perhaps AAPL would charge a fee to stores for using Apple's AR service. As such, YELP is also another company that is ripe for a buyout.

In fact, as of today, both GRPN and YELP are on my buyout list of companies - that AAPL can buy for spare change - that will enhance AAPL's AR services in the future. And the more I think about it, the more I like it.

Bottom line

If AAPL wants to become a household name in the AR space, it will need to make the iPhone 8 AR ready out of the box, and will also need to come up with ways to earn service revenue at the same time.

Making the iPhone 8 the best AR device is the easy part. The hard part is coming up with Apps and services that consumers will use. Perhaps even harder, how AAPL will leverage AR in order to produce service revenue.

While there are many AR Apps today, the truth is they do not work great, or the information provided is really not that helpful. APPL has the money and the resources to leverage AR, however this might require buying companies that provide the information or services that can be incorporated in AR applications.

Both GRPN and YELP are two of my top candidates for a buyout if AAPL decides to take this route.

Apple Inc may move to dividend payout target Apple Inc. shareholders should look for a dividend hike when the company reports third quarter results for fiscal 2017 on April 25, but they should also be listening for comments about the potential implementation of a dividend payout target.

That is something that could become a reality if President Donald Trump s administration makes it more attractive for U.S. companies to repatriate cash held overseas, according to Amit Daryanani at RBC Capital Markets.

The analyst noted that large-cap technology companies have an average dividend payout of about 50 per cent, compared to Apple at roughly 25 per cent.

 Should repatriation occur, we see Apple closing that gap easily,  he told clients.

Apple now has US$246 billion of cash on hand, just US$16 billion of which is in the U.S.

Even without a repatriation tax holiday, Daryanani thinks Apple is able to sustain an annual capital allocation program of more than US$50 billion.

The analyst expects a 10 to 15 per cent dividend hike in April, which would bring Apple s dividend yield to about two per cent, in addition to a potential boost in its share buyback program to as much as US$40 billion per year.

 We think that it is possible that Apple starts guiding to a payout ratio rather than an absolute dollar amount of dividends,  he said.

If Apple is able to repatriate cash at tax rates of nine to 10 per cent, Daryanani noted that it would have access to more than US$220 billion in cash.

Some of that could be returned to shareholders in the form of a special dividend or share buyback, but the analyst believes a big portion will be held back as the company explores its strategic options.

He thinks repatriation may give Apple the balance sheet strength to raise its dividend payout ration to approximately 50 per cent over the long term.

Apple, Inc. Stock Surges Past $140. What's Next? Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has seemingly been hitting new highs every week recently. And now the tech giant's stock has passed $140 and is trading just over $141 this week. With shares rising 21% in the past three months, it's a good time to take a look at Apple's overall business and ponder what's next for the tech giant.

Still an iPhone-driven business

Believe it or not, just over nine years after Apple introduced the first iPhone, the smartphone is still Apple's bread and butter. In Apple's most recent quarter, for instance, the iPhone accounted for a whopping 69% of the company's revenue. Of course, this means Apple's other product segments pale in comparison. Mac, services, iPad, and other products segments represented about 9%, 9%, 7%, and 5% of the total revenue, respectively.

When iPhone sales were soaring, its significant share of revenue was a good thing. But now iPhone's share of revenue is creating a problem for Apple. iPhone unit sales during the trailing 12 months are down 7% compared to the year-ago period, highlighting how difficult it is for Apple to grow sales of its flagship product. Sure, iPhone units and revenue are up about 5% year over year in the company's most recent quarter, providing a glimpse of a possible rebound in iPhone sales -- particularly if Apple's upcoming 10th-anniversary iPhone is as big of an improvement as rumors suggest it will be. But, given the growth headwinds iPhone has faced recently, investors shouldn't count on a sharp rebound in iPhone sales.

With iPhone sales slowing and Apple stock trading at a new all-time high above $140, this may have some investors wondering: Where can the growth come from next?

What's Apple's next big catalyst?

Fortunately, even if iPhone sales struggle to grow from here, two areas of Apple's business are offering promising prospects: services and other products.

Services is probably Apple's most important catalyst. Indeed, while Mac revenue in Apple's most recent quarter was greater than services revenue -- thanks to the company's recent introduction of its new MacBook Pro laptops -- on a trailing-12-month basis, services revenue is now greater than Mac revenue. During this period, services accounted for a strong 12% of total revenue -- slightly higher than Mac's 11% share of total Apple revenue.

Apple's services revenue in the company's most recent quarter hit an all-time high of $7.2 billion -- up 18% year over year. And there's good reason to expect Apple's services revenue will continue growing. For instance, Apple's App Store revenue, which is part of the company's services segment, was up 43% year over year in Apple's holiday quarter. Furthermore, management has forecast annual services revenue will double over the next four years, growing to just over $50 billion in 2020.

Apple's other products segment is more of a wild card than services. Accounting for just 5% of trailing-12-month revenue, the segment is still very small as a proportion of total revenue. However, the 2014 introduction of Apple Watch has proven the company can carry over its brand power to new product segments. Sure, the product hasn't transformed into a major revenue driver for the company. But it's still faring well several years after its launch, with Apple reporting Apple Watch revenue was at an all-time high in the company's most recent quarter.

Combining Apple stock's conservative valuation with a promising outlook for its services and other products segments, I'm still betting on Apple stock -- even above $140. A Glimpse Into Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) 3D Upgrade and Micron Technology, Inc.'s ... Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the forefront of 3D technology and are Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) DRAM pricing concerns overblown? J.P. Morgan and Nomura think so. One analyst chimes in assessing Apple s draw to AR has more to do with the front-facing 3D sensor package near-term while another analyst is steadfastly bullish on Micron in his quarterly print preview, finding wary investors have misplaced their bull s eye on soft DRAM spot pricing. Let s dive in:

Apple Tipping in Favor of 3D Technology

J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall weighs in on the Apple iPhone X rumble, excited about the potential for 3-D scanning. Therefore, in anticipation of the launch, rumored to hit this fall, the analyst reiterates an Overweight rating on shares of AAPL with a $142 price target, which aligns with current levels.

Though the analyst foresees Apple will dabble in augmented reality down the road, short-term, he sees 3D technology taking center stage, with an infrared camera likely to be on the front of the iPhone X, adding $10 to $150 to the price tag.

Hall explains,  Apple certainly has an interest in AR (augmented reality) as a long-term technology, but we do not expect this sensor to initially be used for that purpose. We believe Apple is initially planning to use the front-facing 3D sensor package for highly accurate biometric facial recognition. In our opinion this is due to the removal of a home button on the OLED [ ] and the difficulty that various companies have had in getting under screen fingerprint sensors to work. Apple itself talks about a 1 in 50,000 chance that another person is able to unlock your phone using their fingerprint. We believe that this type of detailed 3D facial mapping may provide a significantly higher level of security, which would likely be of interest to Apple Pay payment providers as well as merchants. 

Ultimately,  We realize that AR has more  fake news  appeal than facial recognition. However, we believe that facial scanning biometrics would alleviate irritating fingerprint sensor failure in the wet conditions iPhones are now designed to survive. We also suspect that facial recognition is more secure than 1 in 50,000 fingerprint scanning and could help with Apple Pay adoption,  Hall concludes.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, four-star analyst Rod Hall is ranked #1,105 out of 4,564 analysts. Hall has a 48% success rate and earns 6.2% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, Hall gains 15.0% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics show AAPL as a Buy. Out of 36 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 28 are bullish on Apple stock, 6 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 6%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $149.50.

Micron Earnings Should Not Revolve Around DRAM Pricing

Nomura analyst Romit Shah offers a confident earnings preview on Micron ahead of the print expected Thursday after market close. For investors tripped up on the smoke-and-mirrors effect of DRAM pricing trends, the analyst redirects focus, believing it is a mistake to let DRAM encompass the whole earnings picture.

As such, the analyst remains unfazed by present valuation, seeing it as a reflection of overblown concerns regarding  weaker  DRAM pricing trends. Ahead of the print, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on MU with a price target of $30, which represents a 14% increase from where the shares last closed.

Shah opines,  We believe investors are overly focused on DRAM spot pricing because it was a leading indicator that was largely ignored during the last downturn. [ ] we believe the setup today is noticeably different than the fall of 2014 and supportive of a higher stock price over the coming periods. 

 The direction of operating margin over the last five years has strongly correlated with Micron s price-to-book multiple and share price; however, the relationship has broken down recently,  explains the analyst.

However, Shah does acknowledge,  Spot pricing flattened out over the last month and suffered a notable decline of almost 2% last week,  which was the first week-over-week dip from November. From the analyst s eyes, this stems from the trouble spot of the smartphone market in China playing catch up with spot pricing.

Overall,  While pricing is a key driver of operating margin, we believe investors are overly preoccupied with DRAM pricing trends. To put things in context, DRAM spot pricing was a leading indicator that was largely ignored during the prior down-cycle. Spot pricing peaked in August 2014, while positive estimate revisions and MU s share price peaked in December 2014,  Shah contends.

According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Romit Shah is ranked #187 out of 4,564 analysts. Shah has a 63% success rate and realizes 14.7% in his yearly returns. When recommending MU, Shah yields 32.9% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate MU as a Strong Buy. Based on 20 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, all 20 rate a Buy on Micron stock. The 12-month average price target stands at $30, marking a 14% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

Apple: What's The iPad Strategy? Over the weekend, there was an interesting report out regarding Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the 2017 refresh of the iPad. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, a veteran at Apple product predictions, discussed how three new tablets may be coming to market in the coming months. While the analyst seems to believe Apple's tablet business is reaching an inflection point, I'm not sure if there is a strategy currently that will work for investors. Here's Kuo's main thesis:

The new models will come in 12.9", 10-10.5" and 9.7" versions. We note the 12.9" model will be the second generation of the existing 12.9" iPad Pro, the 10-10.5" model will be the high-end model equipped with a narrow bezel design, and the 9.7" model will be the low-priced option. The former two models will have an A10X chip manufactured by TSMC (2330 TT, NT$183.5, N), while the latter comes with an A9 chip made by Samsung LSI. Although we estimate iPad shipments in 2017 will drop again YoY to 35-37mn units, we expect the decline to narrow to 10% from 2016's roughly 20%, given that the 10-10.5" model may see more demand from commercial/enterprises and tender markets, while the low-priced 9.7" model may have a greater shipment contribution and likely account for 50-60% of total shipments of new iPads.

Kuo believes that a rise in average selling prices from the new, more expensive models will offset some of the unit sales decline, meaning total iPad revenues won't fall off as much. At this point, I'm not sure if that's really meaningful given the tablet business is essentially in fourth place for Apple, behind the iPhone, Mac, and services business as a whole. As I discussed previously, the iPad has lost a tremendous amount of luster, with the possibility that another year or two of unit sales declines could put the iPad down 50% from its all-time best year.

(Source: Apple 10-K filings; *53-week fiscal year)

My question involving strategy has to do with screen size. From the report above, Apple may have a 9.7 inch model along with a 10-10.5 inch one, with the larger one with better tech specs and thus being more expensive. At that point, why even have the 9.7 inch? If consumers want a cheaper model, they'll go with the 7.9 inch iPad mini that costs a lot less. The table below shows the last time each of these models was updated.

Apple would be giving an update to the two "Pro" models, which happen to also be the two models that were updated most recently. If the company does not launch a Mini in the next few months, it most likely will not have a small tablet upgrade until September or October, meaning a two-year cycle for upgrades. That will not help slow a unit sales decline. In terms of the mini, I'm still not even sure why Apple has the 2 on sale. That model will likely be discontinued if the company is going towards a "cheap" 9.7 inch version.

In the end, Apple needs to figure out what its strategy with the iPad truly is. Right now, it seems as if it is a ship that has no course, and the latest report suggesting screen sizes doesn't seem to change my opinion in that regard. I personally believe that Apple should have a lineup focused just on screen sizes, not trying to squeeze different screen sizes and price points into one big mess. Go with simplicity, like we have with the iPhone (SE, regular, Plus). For the iPad, a lineup of 7.9 inch, 9.7-10.5 inch, and 12.9 inch would seem to work. Stick to a consistent upgrade cycle, and discount older models when they are a year old. One Silicon Valley veteran, who formerly worked at Apple, sums it up best regarding the debacle over the Mac Pro:

Apple, from all indications I've seen over the last year and with the configurations they've shipped with these new laptops, has forgotten this, and the product configurations seem designed by what will fit the biggest part of the user base with the fewest configuration options. They've chopped off the edges of the bell curve-and big chunks of their key users with them.

If in doubt, Apple should just remember the acronym KISS - Keep It Simple Stupid. Don't try to fit all consumers into one box, or you will end up losing those "edges of the bell curve". Across all of Apple's lineup, that's billions of dollars in revenues, and potential profit, that is lost. You won't return to growth that way.

Apple, Inc. Barely Grew Mac Market Share Last Quarter The iPhone wasn't the only Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) product to stall in 2016. The Mac has certainly seen better days, too, and the Mac maker lost global PC market share throughout much of 2016. Well, market researcher IDC has just released its latest estimates on the global PC market for the fourth quarter, and there's a little bit of good news for Apple investors. According to the estimates, Apple might have barely notched a gain in its global PC market share.

A total of 70.2 million PCs were shipped in the fourth quarter, representing a year-over-year decline of 1.5%. Apple shipped roughly 5.3 million Macs by IDC's count, which represents a decline of just 0.9%. That's technically enough to earn Apple a tiny bit more market share, performing slightly better than the broader market.

Breaking the trend

According to IDC's quarterly estimates, Apple underperformed the PC market in Q2 and Q3, so outperforming the PC market in Q4, however slight, still breaks the negative trend.

Quarter Apple Change (YOY) Worldwide PC Market Change (YOY) Q1 2016 (2.1%) (11.5%) Q2 2016 (8.3%) (4.5%) Q3 2016 (13%) (3.9%) Q4 2016 (0.9%) (1.5%)

However, it's worth noting that IDC's estimates don't always line up with the actual volumes that Apple reports. In fact, Apple's official figures are worse than IDC's for the first three quarters of 2016 (Q4 results will be released later this month). The company saw Mac units fall by 11.6% in the first quarter, so Apple actually lost share for the first three quarters of the year.

This marks the fifth consecutive year that the global PC market has contracted. For the full year, there were an estimated 260.2 million PCs shipped worldwide, down 5.7% from 2015. Rivals like HP and Dell fared well, growing by 1.3% and 4.3% respectively.

Back to the Mac

Apple has seemingly recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, which is also when it launched its controversial new MacBook Pro. On one hand, the new notebook suffered from supply constraints throughout most of the quarter. Many customers that placed orders early still didn't receive their products until December. It's challenging to fully gauge demand when suffering from supply constraints.

More broadly, Apple has received some deserved criticism over its continued neglect of the Mac, despite recent comments from CEO Tim Cook that Apple is "very committed" to the Mac and that "great desktops" are in the pipeline. Even Apple's former ad man Ken Segall is boggled by what is taking the company so long to update its lineup.

For the longest time, Apple disregarded traditional resource allocation methodologies, simply focusing on building great products and trusting that the financials will take care of themselves. But it seems that under Cook the company may be implementing traditional resource allocation methodologies, where the most important products (iOS devices) get the most attention. It doesn't matter if this is a conscious decision or an inadvertent one -- Mac development is clearly suffering. As long as the Mac remains second-class relative to the iPhone, investors can continue to expect market share losses.

Apple Inc. Planning New iPad Launches in 1st Half of 2017 According to a pre-publication note in DigiTimes, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is preparing to launch three new iPad models in the first half of 2017. The note, which doesn't include too many details, says that in the first quarter of 2017 -- this quarter -- Apple will begin producing what it refers to as a "9.7-inch iPad with a friendly price range."

Then, in the second quarter, Apple is expected to begin producing two flagship products: an updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro and a 10.5-inch iPad. The note doesn't refer to it as an "iPad Pro," curiously enough.

Apple's iPad business has been struggling for quite some time, with multiple years of unit declines. To put things in perspective, Apple shipped nearly 68 million iPads in its fiscal 2014; that figure plunged to 54.9 million in fiscal 2015 and then to 45.6 million in fiscal 2016.

Revenue, too, has struggled as well, with iPad-related revenues dropping from $30.3 billion in 2014 to $23.2 billion in 2015, and then again to $20.6 billion in 2016.

Apple obviously isn't going to give up on this product line, so its best course of action is to continue to invest in building excellent products to try to stimulate demand -- or, more pessimistically, stem the rate of demand declines.

Let's take a closer look at what we should expect from these new iPad models, and what they could mean for Apple's iPad business.

The cheaper 9.7-inch iPad

Today's 9.7-inch iPad offerings consist of the discounted iPad Air 2 and the pricier 9.7-inch iPad Pro. The latter has a faster processor than the former (A9X vs A8X), superior wide-color True Tone display, improved cameras, support for the Apple Pencil, and support for Apple's smart keyboard.

Previously, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said that the cheaper 9.7-inch iPad will incorporate an Apple A9 chip manufactured by Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF). The use of the A9 chip in the low-cost 9.7-inch model, rather than the A9X that's currently featured inside the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, should make the device cheaper to manufacture.

Additionally, by using the A9 in the cheaper model, Apple will be able to market a larger performance delta between the low-cost 9.7-inch iPad and the pricier 10.5-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad Pro.

It will be interesting to see how else Apple de-features the cheaper 9.7-inch iPad to both save costs and encourage upsell to the 10.5-inch or 12.9-inch models. Apple Pencil and Smart Keyboard support seem likely candidates for the chopping block here.

In terms of impact on Apple's iPad business, it's generally a good thing to deliver more value for the money with new products at a regular clip, but this doesn't seem likely to be a game changer for the iPad business.

The newer 10.5-inch and 12.9-inch models

The more interesting products will almost certainly be the higher-end 10.5-inch iPad and 12.9-inch iPad Pro. These should include faster A10X processors, potentially upgraded display technology, and -- in the case of the 10.5-inch model -- a newer design or form factor.

The current 12.9-inch iPad Pro launched in November 2015, so it's getting quite long in the tooth   regular device improvements are generally needed to catalyze demand. The good news is that if Apple can deliver a worthwhile refresh, it should be able to boost demand for its jumbo-sized iPad model.

The real star of the show, though, is likely to be the 10.5-inch model. It's been a long time since Apple has fundamentally changed the look and feel of its iPad models, but that looks set to change with this product.

For one thing, Apple is moving from a 9.7-inch display to a 10.5-inch display, an interesting change. Beyond that, the device is rumored to have very thin bezels, in sharp contrast to the very large ones found on the current 9.7-inch iPad Air/iPad Pro models.

The device may have a significantly improved aesthetic, which could help jump-start customer interest.

Additionally, if Apple includes the "faster display technology" Bloomberg mentioned last year, then this could really transform the user experience, as high refresh-rate displays make things so much smoother.

Apple's iPad business could get a nice boost in the second quarter from these new products. Additionally, the buzz that these products may potentially generate could help keep people interested in Apple ahead of the launch of its next-generation iPhone models in the fall. Despite Criticism, Apple Inc. Found To Offer Best Experience In Every Category Apple always had an image of being an innovator and general leader of all things exciting, but recently, several questions about this were raised. Many accused the company of not being an innovator anymore, claiming that not only it is dull, but also its products are the same and old. However, real people who have a different opinion say that the brand delivers more than any other in all the product categories in which it operates.

Apple leads in all categories

Research consultancy Brand Keys just released its 2017 Customer Loyalty Engagement Index, which seeks to find the  category drivers that engage customers,  drive real profits and engender loyalty. The survey included 49,168 consumers in the age group 16 to 65. The result will definitely make Apple CEO Tim Cook happy.

Apple was found to be the top driver in the smartphones, laptops and tablets category. This is when Apple s recently-launched MacBook Pro had not been that successful. Even Apple Music made it to the top spot in online music, defeating rival Spotify. In the headphones category, Apple-owned Beats was tied with LG, the firm said.

In a press release, Brand Keys president Robert Passikoff said customer expectations in all product categories are expected to soar. For example, customer expectations grew 35% in the online sector in the past 12 months.

Apple updates pro video apps

Apple also recently updated its video editing tools, including Final Cut Pro X, Motion and Compressor, with several bug fixes, minor additions and general improvements. Final Cut Pro got a large number of new features, including a handful of audio-related capabilities, notes Apple Insider.

Apple has especially highlighted the ability to add custom folders of audio files to the Sound Effects browser. The company updated the user interface tools as well, after which the application of ripple delete to audio-only clips doesn t disable the selected range. Also audio meters retain their custom width settings after relaunching the app.

Increased responsiveness when editing long project files, better H.264 file handling for exporting and changing frame rate are among the other changes. For better handling of transparencies, the ProRes 4444 file support has been improved as well.

Several issues have also been fixed, such as the one in which adjusting the line spacing of multi-line titles applied to the first line only. The issue that prevented burning Final Cut Pro projects to DVD via Apple USB SuperDrive has also been fixed.

Apple Inc filed a $1 billion lawsuit against supplier Qualcomm Inc on Friday, days after the U.S. government accused the chip maker of resorting to anticompetitive tactics to maintain a monopoly over key semiconductors in mobile phones.

Qualcomm is a major supplier to both Apple and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd for "modem" chips that connect phones to wireless networks. The two companies together accounted for 40 percent of Qualcomm's $23.5 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year.

In the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California, Apple accused Qualcomm of overcharging for chips and refusing to pay some $1 billion in promised rebates. Apple said in its complaint that Qualcomm withheld the rebates because of Apple's discussions with South Korea's antitrust regulator, the Korea Fair Trade Commission.

"If that were not enough, Qualcomm then attempted to extort Apple into changing its responses and providing false information to the KFTC in exchange for Qualcomm's release of those payments to Apple. Apple refused," Apple said in its lawsuit.

In a statement, Qualcomm General Counsel Don Rosenberg called Apple's claims "baseless."

"Apple has been actively encouraging regulatory attacks on Qualcomm s business in various jurisdictions around the world, as reflected in the recent KFTC decision and FTC complaint, by misrepresenting facts and withholding information," Rosenberg said in the statement.

"We welcome the opportunity to have these meritless claims heard in court where we will be entitled to full discovery of Apple s practices and a robust examination of the merits. 

Qualcomm's stock closed 2.4 percent lower at $62.88 on the news.

Qualcomm has patents for chips which include standard essential patents, a term used to describe technology that is required to be licensed broadly and on "reasonable" terms.

In its lawsuit, Apple accused Qualcomm of refusing to license the technology to other manufacturers to prevent them from making the chips.

It also accused Qualcomm of selling chips while requiring Apple to pay a separate licensing fee for the same chips, in a "no license, no chip" policy.

In addition, Qualcomm pressured network carriers to not sell or support Apple devices made with Intel chipsets Apple said.

The KFTC fined Qualcomm $854 million in December for what it called unfair patent licensing practices.

In February 2015, Qualcomm paid a $975 million fine in China, while the European Union in December 2015 accused it of abusing its market power to thwart rivals.

On Tuesday, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm, saying the San Diego-based company used its dominant position as a supplier of certain phone chips to impose "onerous" supply and licensing terms on cellphone manufacturers. Qualcomm said it would contest the FTC complaint.

Qualcomm was the sole supplier of modem chips for Apple s phones until the release of the iPhone 7 in September. Intel Corp supplied about half of the modem chips for the newest models, said Stacy Rasgon, a senior analyst at Bernstein Research. Intel's shares closed up 1 percent at $36.94 after the Qualcomm suit was announced.

Apple made the move around the same time that Samsung, which had switched to using its own internal chips for its Galaxy S6 phones, returned to Qualcomm for the Galaxy S7.

Qualcomm "has been able to manage through (the Apple contract loss) pretty well because they got back Samsung at the same time," Rasgon said.

Apple is known for seeking multiple suppliers to keep prices down, said Jim Morrison, vice president of technical intelligence for TechInsights, which tears down devices to analyze their parts.

(Reporting by Diane Bartz in Washington and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Cynthia Osterman) Apple: An Unexpected Positive Appears I believe this is about to change, and it has implications for growth rates even if quantities continue to stagnate.

This has happened in the context of slowly-increasing BoM costs as well as a recently stagnated smartphone market.

Over the years, the smartphone flagship has remained amazingly stable, especially when it comes to Apple.

At this point, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) already seems to be influenced by the iPhone 8 upcoming launch, around September. There are some indications that the iPhone 7 might be slowing down more than expected, but it hasn't been a tremendous factor in punishing the stock.

However, I believe a new factor, beyond the iPhone 7 and 8 dynamics, is about to emerge this year which will be an unexpected positive for Apple (and Samsung).

First A Bit Of Background

Over time, flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung have seen rather stable pricing. For instance, upon launch in June 2010, the base iPhone 4 had an unlocked price of $649. Fast forward to the iPhone 7 six years later, and the unlocked price for the base version still remains at $649.

Sure, the larger iPhone Plus versions, since the iPhone 6 Plus, were $100 more expensive, and saw a slight bump with the iPhone 7 Plus, to a $120 difference. These represented a very modest attempt to increase prices in the face of what has been a BoM (Bill of Materials) creeping higher over time (I, II).

At least three factors made for this price stability:

A strong smartphone market, allowing for constant units sold increases. The market was also helped by a massive transition from feature phones to smartphones.

Ever-plunging component prices, which kept BoM increases in check (though on an upward trajectory).

Significant pressure from ever-cheaper competition, especially as Chinese competitors started entering the market, and as some Android makers (HTC, LG) started lagging in their competitiveness.

Of these, however, signs are that the strong smartphone market is slowing down significantly. The following chart exemplifies this slowdown easily enough:

Source: BusinessInsider.com, others

This brings us to today and to signs that we're about to enter a new phase.

The New Phase - Brands Will Price Higher

In light of extremely significant pressure from Chinese suppliers, what follows is something of a surprise.

You see, you can get a perfectly functional, well-designed, fast and featured smartphone for as little as $150 from a Chinese brand like Xiaomi, Elephone, LeTV, OnePlus and countless others. The differences to an Apple or Samsung flagship will be in the detail, but these phones (all on Android) will run everything in Google Play with aplomb.

Yet, for someone wanting the very best the market can offer, the choice is still between Apple, Samsung and, perhaps, the new Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pixel line.

Oftentimes, with branded products, the price differential is well in excess of any rational specification or quality differences. The same is apparently set to happen in the smartphone market. That is, the price differential should, from 2017 onwards, expand not just because the Chinese are pricing ever lower, but also and most importantly, because Apple and Samsung are set to increase the prices in their own flagship range.

As I said earlier, a bit of a clue came in a $20 increase in the iPhone 7 Plus versus the iPhone 6s. However, I think there are signs that this trend will significantly pick up the pace during 2017. How will this happen? For now, at least in two different ways:

Samsung is set to launch the Galaxy S8 series. Contrary to the Galaxy S7, where you had a flat S7 and a curved S7 Edge, both versions of the Galaxy S8 will be curved. At launch, the Galaxy S7 carried a $695 unlocked price and the S7 Edge carried a $795 unlocked price. These prices were somewhat overstated, though, as right from the start there was the chance of getting Galaxy VR for free, or $50-$100 discounts. The Galaxy S8, though, is rumored to start at ~$795-$845, thus as much as $100 over the base S7. While this is a rumor, a large price increase is nearly certain, stemming from both phones evolving towards edge variants.

As for Apple, it's still early to have any rumors on price. There's no certainty that Apple will increase the base entry price for the lowest model. But there, the price increases are certain to take place at least through another route. That will be the introduction of a third model in the range. That is, we'll have the iPhone 8, the 8 Plus and yet another model which will retail at a significant premium. This third model will be the most revolutionary of the 3, and will likely be all-glass and carry a bezel-less OLED display   as well as a price near $999.

I believe the trend toward higher premium prices will mostly be connected to countering the market slowdown. It will substitute the growth through quantity by growth through price. Even a minor 10% average price increase can do wonders on stagnated shipping quantities if one considers that Apple's expected revenue growth rate is +5.6% for FY2017 and +7.1% for FY2018.

However, there is also another potential factor driving the need to increase prices. DRAM has been shooting up for nearly a year now:

Source: DramExchange.com

This index, representing the DRAM spot market, sat at ~5,800 in March 2016. It has been up nearly every day since and now sits 177% higher.

Of course, it reflects spot pricing, and contract pricing has evolved slower, but still went up meaningfully. This is more of a factor forcing Samsung, though, as its phones presently carry twice the RAM on the iPhones (4GB vs 2GB) and the difference might even increase in the next generation.

Conclusion

While price increases are not something that's factored in Apple market expectations, there are signs that these are going to occur in 2017, both for Apple and Samsung.

As a counter-weight, Chinese suppliers are getting ever-better and their prices are low and going lower. So this will be a play on keeping volume while raising prices by using brand power. The objective will be to counter a stagnating overall smartphone market.

Given Apple and Samsung's brand power, the strategy has a good likelihood both of happening, and of working, as long as the new models are appealing enough. Both Samsung and Apple new models will show radically increased display areas with reduced bezels. They will be visually striking and, when it comes to Apple, quite different from what Apple has been selling for the last three years. This also increases the likelihood of this (mostly unexpected) strategy to work.

(AAPL) Stock Can't Please Everybody I have to admit straight off the bat that I m not too fond of writing about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). For starters, everyone   and I do mean everyone   has an opinion on Apple stock.

Source: Apple

Even those that may be uninterested in the markets, or consumers who prefer products from Samsung Electronic (OTCMKTS: SSNLF ) or Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE: SNE ), still seem to throw in their two cents. That s the power of the Apple brand.

I m not complaining. Although I have a financial interest in SNE stock, and have owned Samsung smartphones in the past, Apple products are better. Its ecosystem is seamlessly connected, and its interface is intuitive. Best of all, the company has an uncanny ability to provide solutions for which you have yet to realize is a problem. And no   finding a good-looking, untucked dress shirt is not a real problem!

The central issue I have with Apple stock is that investors may be too emotionally vested. If there s any advice I can give, it s that business is all about the numbers. Holding any other view could lead you down a dangerous path.

Positive Factors Buoying Apple Stock

Admittedly, Apple stock doesn t make market agnosticism easy. The heart of the organization of course is the iPhone. Last Friday, rumors circulated that the upcoming iPhone 8 will feature better water resistance than its predecessor. The improvement could potentially allow the  8  to survive immersion greater than one meter deep. Whether the safety feature is actually useful or not, it s a great marketing tool. Samsung initiated their waterproof model with their Galaxy GS4 Active to critical acclaim.

Of course, there s much more to Apple s flagship product than making it accident proof. According to InvestorPlace writer Tom Taulli, there are already  indications that the device will be standout, such as with OLED (organic light emitting diodes) screens, which will be thinner and perhaps even allow for bending. Interestingly enough, there may not even be a bezel, which will not only make the device look sleeker   one of Apple s hallmarks   but allow more room on the screen. 

We also must consider the Apple stock price in comparative value against the broader consumer technology industry. As Taulli notes,  AAPL stock still sports a reasonable valuation, with the forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11.5X. Hey, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) is at 19X and Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL ) is trading at 14X. 

To go along with this analysis, you have to appreciate the creative synergy that drives Apple stock. Despite roadblocks like the Supreme Court decision that has serious implications for intellectual property rights, AAPL, and by extension, AAPL stock keeps on chugging. I don t doubt for a second that they ll continue asserting themselves in the retail market. They re too much of a valuable entity for any other course of action.

Weaknesses in Apple s Armor

Yet it s in the financial markets where Apple stock loses some sheen. As Investor s Business Daily wryly notes, in the same year that AAPL  opens an edifice to its greatness   a massive new headquarters that looks like a flying saucer   the company faces growing questions about its future and whether it can still surprise and delight customers with exciting new gadgets.  Furthermore, expectations are  sky-high that 2017 s 10th anniversary iPhone will be something special that unleashes the full potential of the Apple revenue-generating ecosystem. 

No one questions that AAPL stock is backed by a solid team carrying out founder Steve Jobs  grand vision. Nevertheless, that s a lot of pressure riding on the company. It s a well-known fact that a majority of AAPL s sales and profits comes from the iPhone. In fact, we are starting to see some kinks in the vaunted armor.

Again, Investor s Business Daily writes that iPhone  sales declined last year for the first time ever, during the iPhone 6S cycle. They could fall again this year, during the iPhone 7 cycle. In fiscal 2016, iPhone unit sales declined 8%, while iPhone revenue shrank 12%. 

Furthermore, there s an overreliance on its smartphone division that could come back to haunt them. A glaring example is the fact that Apple hasn t done much of anything with its premium line of Mac computers. Sure, that industry is in decline, but Apple has always been chic-cool. If it s abandoning Macs in favor of portable e-devices, it s going to be in a dogfight with discount-price leaders.

And if it can t protect its designs as the Supreme Court decision implies, that just makes Apple s job all the more difficult. Hence, it either needs to kill it with its new iPhones or it needs other products for diversification.

Next Page Apple Inc. New iPads Might Be Late to the Party (AAPL) It s a pretty safe bet at this point that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is releasing new iPads in 2017. Rumors had been pointing to a March special event for AAPL to take the wraps off its latest tablets, including the iPad Air 3 and two new iPad Pro models.

However, a newly released report   based on information from Apple s supply chain   suggests the launch may be pushed to the second half of 2017.

New iPads Delayed

9to5Mac reported on a Digitimes story based on sources from within Apple s supply chain. These sources claim that the new iPads are still in the planning stage, and may not be released or even announced until the second half of 2017.

Many Apple watchers expected a March special event announcing the new iPads (the 9.7-inch iPad Pro was unveiled at a March 2016 event), but that timeframe now seems in doubt. Summer product announcements are practically unheard of. Everyone is in vacation mode and not paying close attention to what tech companies are doing. That makes a fall announcement and release the most likely option if spring falls through.

MacRumors elaborated on potential causes for the delay, besides the generic  being stuck in the design phase  description. The site points to speculation that the new A10X processor, which would power the new iPad Pro models, is running into manufacturing challenges. Reports since December have said the chips are suffering from lower than expected yield rates.

If so, this wouldn t be the first time pushing the boundaries of technology has tripped up Apple, or other consumer tech companies. Fitbit Inc (NYSE: FIT ) and GoPro Inc (NASDAQ: GPRO ) both faced retail shortages of new products prior to Christmas due to production issues.

What to Expect: New iPad Pro Models and iPad Air 3

While nothing is certain when trying to anticipate AAPL s moves, the expectation of what the company will release in terms of new iPads is beginning to firm up.

The consensus among Apple watchers and analysts is leaning toward a second generation, 12.9-inch iPad Pro, powered by the A10X chip. This is AAPL s flagship tablet, competing against the likes of Microsoft Corporation s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro 4. Apple will want to keep its momentum in the professional/enterprise tablet space.

An all-new iPad Pro model in the form of a 10.5-inch, bezel-free device that s a more business-friendly size than the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro likely will make its debut.

As for the 9.7-inch form factor, that s up in the air. It s too small for many business users, so there s a good chance Apple will drop the  Pro  designation. Instead, it would become the new low-cost midsize tablet in the Apple lineup, repackaged as the iPad Air 3.

Experts also expect a new version of the Apple Pencil stylus to be in the mix.

Apple, Inc. Is Now Approaching $100 Billion in Debt Just days after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings release last week, the company raised a cool $10 billion in debt. Like prior bond sales, this one consisted of numerous tranches with maturities of up to 30 years, and included both fixed-rate notes as well as some floaters. There wasn't really much that was notable about the bond offering itself; it's comparable to the paper that Apple sells every year.

Principal Fixed or Floating Rate Maturity $500 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 8 basis points 2019 $500 million Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 20 basis points 2020 $1 billion Floating 3-month LIBOR plus 50 basis points 2022 $500 million Fixed 1.55% 2019 $1 billion Fixed 1.9% 2020 $1.5 billion Fixed 2.5% 2022 $1.75 billion Fixed 3% 2024 $2.25 billion Fixed 3.35% 2027 $1 billion Fixed 4.25% 2047

However, it was done a bit earlier the usual this time around, and Apple is now approaching $100 billion in debt.

It's the time of the season

Typically, Apple conducts these bond offerings shortly after providing updates to its capital return program, which is usually alongside its April earnings release. They usually occur in April or May. But Apple needed to sell the bonds slightly earlier this year for a few interrelated reasons.

Apple entered into its ninth accelerated share repurchase program last quarter, and total share repurchases were $11 billion. That took a big bite out of Apple's domestic cash position, and the company exited the quarter with $15.9 billion in domestic cash. That's the low end of Apple's comfort zone; Apple usually keeps its domestic cash in the range of $15 billion to $25 billion for operational and strategic needs.

Note how Apple's domestic cash has dwindled in recent years due to aggressive capital return activity. (This chart does not reflect the recent bond offering.)

The company simply blew through its domestic dollars a little faster than usual this year with share repurchases.

$100 billion and counting

Since debt largely funds Apple's massive capital returns, the debt load that it has taken on over the past five years is commensurately large. At the end of 2016, Apple had $87.5 billion in long-term debt (including the current portion) and commercial paper, which is just short-term unsecured debt. The recent $10 billion bond offering will now bring that figure up to around $97.5 billion.

The offering was still able to fetch investment-grade credit ratings, but it goes without saying that the more debt that Apple takes on over time, the worse its credit rating profile becomes. Meanwhile, there's been a lot of talk about a potential tax repatriation holiday from the Trump administration. If Apple is able to bring home a meaningful chunk of the $230.2 billion that now sits overseas, it could theoretically extinguish some of that debt and strengthen the balance sheet. That could effectively give Apple a few more years to continue its debt-funded capital return strategy.

Until then, Apple will just have to keep selling paper. Reasons Why Apple Is Hot To Manufacture In India India is too large a market for Apple to not go all out after.

In the middle of last week, new broke that the state government of Karnataka (state in India where the city of Bangalore/Bengaluru is located) had reached an agreement with Apple to allow the latter to set up a assembly/manufacturing plant with Wistron.

Over the weekend, Priyank Kharge, IT minister for Karnataka, said that he believed Apple would "tentatively begin manufacturing iPhones in the state by the end of April or beginning of May."

After reaching saturation point in smartphone growth here at home and in China, Apple is left with India as its next growth frontier. That is not to say that Apple will not make gains in China and in the U.S however, in these countries the fight is now for market share. It's a zero-sum game for Apple in China and in the U.S. That is, Apple's gains in market share will come at the expense of its competition.

On the other hand, in India, the market is wide open and at the moment is dominated with cheap handsets that cost between $100-$250 per unit. eMarketer estimates that barely 20% of the almost 800 million cellular handsets in India are smartphones, so, yes indeed, the market is wide open for mid-to-high-end smartphones in India.

Market research firm Counterpoint stated that Apple was the 10th-ranked smartphone manufacturer in terms of shipments in India in Q4 2016. The firm estimated that Chinese OEMs like Oppo and Vivo and Xiaomi dominated the Indian smartphone market with a combined share of 47% in Q4:16. Counterpoint also noted that Apple controlled 62% of the market share for devices priced above $650.

Even that $650 per unit price point is out of reach of the Indian masses however with the already massive middle class (400 million and growing) having easy access to monthly payment options, a price point a bit lower could allow Apple to capture share rapidly. Apple phones are considered the Rolls Royce of smartphones in most of Asia and India is not an exception by any means.

In terms of market share of the overall smartphone market in India, it is estimated that Apple has just a 2%-4% market share at the moment.

If Apple can get the cost of locally assembled/manufactured phones down low enough to start its entry-level models at $375-$450 per unit, the potential explosion in sales could go a long way in countering slowing demand in China and elsewhere in the West.

India is and will continue to be one of the fastest growing economies in the world and is a country that Apple cannot afford to overlook.

This manufacturing or assembly plant in Bangalore will go a long way in ensuring Apple's continued dominance and lions share of global smartphone profitability for a long time to come.

Stay tuned. There will be a lot more from the analyst/sellsider community in the coming days and weeks on Apple in India and the positive effects on revenues and profits going forward.

Currency Woes Force Apple, Inc. to Increase UK App Store Prices This isn't the first time that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had to increase international prices in response to currency fluctuations. Generally speaking, the U.S. dollar has been on a multiyear run, strengthening against most of the world's currencies since 2014. In recent memory, we've seen the company adjust prices in Russia following incredible volatility of the ruble in 2014, followed by Canada, Australia, and the European Union in 2015. Importantly, currency risks aren't going away anytime soon, considering the fact that roughly two-thirds of Apple's business comes from abroad.

Following the U.K.'s historic decision last summer to exit the European Union, the pound has taken an utter beating relative to the dollar. The pound's weakening is largely in response to concerns around the economic impacts of Brexit combined with capital outflows coming out of U.K.

In response to the pound's continued weakness, Apple has been forced to increase prices in its U.K. App Store by approximately 25%. This isn't a decision that Apple takes lightly; it knows that pricing volatility is bad for consumers, and price increases naturally hurt local demand. "We price our products in a way that is in general reflective of pricing here in the United States and it's a pricing that we want to keep in place for reasonable periods of time," CFO Luca Maestri noted on a 2014 earnings call. "We do not like to make sudden changes to our pricing."

But Apple has to balance its own financial needs with those of consumers, and if the fluctuations are beyond the scope of its currency hedging program, it has little choice but to adjust prices in order to preserve its financials.

The more important price hike is already in the rearview mirror

The silver lining for investors is that adjusting App Store prices will likely have a pretty small impact on the business. Remember, this is for digital content that the U.K. installed base purchases over time, which subsequently gets accounted for in Apple's services segment. We don't know the size of Apple's installed base in the U.K., but it's not really a large country overall relative to other markets, with a current population of approximately 65 million.

More importantly, Apple already increased the prices for its actual products last year, a couple months after the Brexit vote. In September, Apple increased iPhone and iPad prices, including for the new iPhone 7; the hikes ranged from 30 pounds to 60 pounds. Macs saw more meaningful increases in October, given the higher prices for computers. The Mac Pro saw a price increase of a gut-wrenching 500 pounds. Those price hikes were far more painful for U.K. customers.

Europe isn't a growth market for Apple (sales up just 3% in the third quarter), but hopefully those price increases didn't hurt Apple's sales during the holiday shopping season too badly. Apple reports fourth-quarter results at the end of the month. Will Synaptics Incorporated Win the Touch ID Spot Inside of the OLED Apple Inc ... Analyst Timothy Arcuri with Cowen recently put out a note in which he went over some of the information that his team gleaned from supply chain checks (via AppleInsider). You can read the full AppleInsider article for the rest, but there was one portion of the report that stood out:

Arcuri reiterated those claims, and predicted that Apple may switch to [Synaptics' (NASDAQ:SYNA)] optical-based fingerprint reader for the new Touch ID sensor, citing it as "currently the only workable solution" for detecting a fingerprint through a smartphone screen.

By way of background, Apple purchased a chip company known as AuthenTec back in 2012, and it is this acquisition that gave Apple the key technology and people that allowed it to debut its Touch ID fingerprint scanning technology in the iPhone 5s and in subsequent models.

Does it make sense that Apple will eschew its homebrew fingerprint sensor technology in favor of a solution from Synaptics? Let's take a closer look.

It's possible if Apple's own tech development is behind schedule

It's extremely likely that Apple has been working on technology to support sensing fingerprints through the screen. Indeed, it's extremely unlikely that Apple purchased AuthenTec just so that it could build a couple of generations of fingerprint sensors and then just stop.

Apple would have been better off not buying AuthenTec in the first place and just sourcing fingerprint sensors from them and/or other suppliers in that case.

No, the reason that Apple likely shelled out the money to buy AuthenTec is almost certainly that it wanted to be able to develop differentiated technologies to help realize the company's future product visions.

By developing this technology in-house, Apple not only limits the amount of future product information that it must share with third parties, but -- if successful -- allows Apple to enjoy a competitive advantage for some time.

That's what happened with the original Touch ID, and that could very well be the case that it is developing a unique technology to allow it to scan fingerprints through the screen itself.

Nevertheless, while Apple's technical execution tends to be good, the company is by no means perfect. Apple's development teams may have run into technical snags in developing its homebrew through-the-display fingerprint sensing solution, and it could very well need to lean on third party suppliers -- like Synaptics -- for the right technology.

The potential scenarios

If Apple does turn to Synaptics for fingerprint scanning solutions for the OLED iPhone, this would represent a very nice revenue and profit boost for the latter -- at least through the next iPhone cycle. The risk, of course, is that it would likely only be a matter of time before Apple designed out Synaptics in favor of a homebrew solution, meaning that any financial boost for Synaptics would be short lived.

The other scenario is that Apple's in-house efforts are working just fine and Synaptics doesn't win the business at all. This, in my view, is the more likely scenario.

In either case, though, I'm not optimistic that there's a long-term opportunity for Synaptics to provide fingerprint scanning solutions to Apple. Synaptics' best bet is to continue to court weaker smartphone vendors -- ones that don't have the inclination or ability to develop their own technologies in-house.

Apple, Inc.'s Record Quarter Returns the Company to Growth After market on closed on Tuesday, tech giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) put to rest any doubts about the company's ability to post strong holiday results. Shares moved a few percentage points higher immediately after the company released its figures for its Dec. 31-ending first fiscal quarter of 2017. Apple's revenue and earnings exceeded both management's own forecast for the quarter and analysts' consensus estimate.

Here's a look at some of the biggest takeaways from the results.

Financial results

Metric Q1 2017 Q1 2016 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $78.4 billion $75.9 billion 3.3% Earnings per share $3.36 $3.28 2.4% Gross profit margin 38.5% $40.1% (160 basis points)

Apple's revenue reached an all-time high of $78.4 billion, up 3.3% from the year-ago quarter and above the company's guidance for $76 billion to $78 billion. In addition, Apple's EPS of $3.28 easily exceeded the midpoint of its guidance range for about $3.17.

Segment results

The iPhone remained crucial to Apple's overall results, accounting for nearly 70% of total revenue during the quarter. With a 5% year-over-year increase in iPhone revenue, the product segment played a key role in Apple's better-than-expected financial results.

But the tech giant's services segment, which accounts for sales from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services, was also important. Services revenue was up 18% year over year, accounting for 9.1% of the quarter's total results -- up from 8% in the year-ago quarter. Apple CEO Tim Cook commented specifically on Apple's services segment performance, saying the growth was "led by customer activity on the App Store."

Another bright spot from Apple's segment results was Mac. With the help of its new MacBook Pro, the segment's revenue increased 7% year over year.

However, not all of Apple's product segments were on the rise during the quarter. Apple's iPad revenue continued its downward trend, with revenue falling 22% year over year. Other products revenue, which includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, iPod, and accessories, saw its revenue decline 8% year over year. But Apple was careful to note in its first-quarter press release that despite the decline in other products revenue, Apple Watch revenue hit an all-time high.

Guidance

Apple also notably said it expects revenue growth to continue in the company's second quarter -- an important guide, considering the company reported three straight quarters of year-over-year revenue declines in fiscal 2016. Apple guided for second-quarter revenue to be in the range of $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion, up from $50.6 billion in the year-ago quarter.

Looking beyond the financial results for Apple's second quarter, Cook said the Apple team is "excited" about the products in its pipeline.

The strong quarter for the tech giant, along with a nice return to growth for the current quarter and for expected revenue in Q2, reinforces the company's ability to drive results for shareholders even in a post hyper-iPhone-growth era.

Cook was pleased with the company's performance: "Our team executed extremely well in the face of strong macroeconomic headwinds. We are very happy with the continued strong growth in revenue from services, thanks to the incredible strength of the Apple ecosystem and our growing base of over 1 billion active devices." Apple, Inc. Earnings: 3 Answers From CEO Tim Cook Ahead of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) first-quarter earnings report on Tuesday, investors were primarily looking for the company to show that it can reverse its recent declining iPhone business. And Apple did exactly this, reporting 5% year-over-year growth in both iPhone unit and revenue growth, helping the company's total revenue increase 3% year over year. Even better, the company said it expected more growth in its second quarter.

But beyond Apple's financial performance, investors likely had other questions on their minds -- questions more suitable for management's earning call following the release. To this end, I laid out three questions Apple management would hopefully address during the call. As it turns out, Apple management addressed all three of these important topics.

Here's how Apple CEO Tim Cook and his management team answered these three questions on Tuesday:

1. How confident is management in its product pipeline?

While the iPhone did return to growth in Apple's first quarter, it was still relatively slow growth. The iPhone's headwinds have put the pressure on the company to develop new products to help accelerate growth. While investors obviously shouldn't have expected Apple to spill the beans on anything specific on Tuesday, Tim Cook did express confidence in the company's pipeline of upcoming products.

In Apple's first-quarter earnings press release, Cook said Apple is "very excited" about the products in its pipeline. And during Apple's earnings call, Cook showed even more enthusiasm, saying, "we've got some exciting things in the pipeline; I feel really, really good about it."

2. What could Apple's services revenue growth look like going forward?

Services continue to grow in importance to Apple, and the company's first quarter was no exception. Services revenue climbed 18% year over year, growing to about 9% of total sales, up from about 8% last year. And even this growth understates how sharply the segment is climbing, as the company's services segment benefited from a one-off $548 million patent-infringement payment in the year-ago quarter.

Going forward, Cook said (here's a Reuters transcript of the earnings call) that he expects services to become even more integral to Apple's business:

Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year. Our services offerings are now driving over 150 million paid customer subscriptions. This includes our own services, and third-party content that we offer on our stores. We feel great about this momentum, and our goal is to double the size of our services business in the next four years.

These expectations for Apple's services segment translate to a forecast of about 20% annualized growth over the next four years.

3. If there's a tax break for repatriation, does Apple plan to take advantage of it?

With President Donald Trump saying he plans to offer a one-off tax holiday for U.S. companies to repatriate their overseas funds at a lower tax rate, investors have good reason to be interested in what Apple's CEO thinks of this. After all, of Apple's $246.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, an incredible $230.2 billion is outside of the United States.

Fortunately, Cook talked about this potential holiday, signaling he expected Apple to take full advantage:

I am optimistic given what I'm hearing, that there would likely be some sort of tax reform this year, and it does seem like there's people in both parties that would favor a repatriation as a part of that. So I think that's very good for the country and good for Apple.

But Cook said investors will have to wait to see how repatriated funds would be allocated:

What we would do with it -- let's wait and see exactly what it is -- but as I've said before, we are always looking at acquisitions. We acquired 15 to 20 companies per year for the last four years, and we look for companies of all sizes, and there's not a size that we would not do based on just the size of it. It's more about the strategic value of it.

Beyond acquisitions, Apple could obviously allocate funds toward other capital investments in its own business, a dividend increase, a special dividend, share repurchases, or even all of the above.

While these were some of the more important topics covered during the call, management also covered more details on the company's services business, its regional results, the smartphone market, and more. Investors can find a copy of the earnings call on Apple's investor-relations website. Apple: Investor Optimism For 2017  Apple: Bulls Have Taken Over Yesterday, I wrote a somewhat controversial article on why I believed Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) F1Q17 results and next-quarter outlook did not appear to support a 3% run in the stock price after hours.

The market seems to have disagreed strongly with my points and slapped me hard across the face, pushing shares up an additional +3% by the end of Wednesday's trading session. Being long the stock, my equities portfolio looked good today, but not my reputation for making short-term calls.

Today, after more closely analyzing the topics discussed during last night's earnings call, I take another look at the results and expectations against some of the more skeptical observations that I made yesterday.

China weakness in context

Recall, from my previous article, that Apple posted a -12% YOY dip in sales in China. While better than the previous three quarters, there was little to cheer about the double-digit decline in that country - at least on the surface.

During the conference call, however, CFO Luca Maestri explained:

Revenue from Mainland China was even with the all-time record results from a year ago, and grew in constant currency terms. [ ] This year we grew China inventory significantly less than a year ago.

There are three important pieces of information in this short statement. First, currency headwinds (which I generally treat as a non-recurring, hard-to-anticipate event) played a significant factor in the China underperformance this past quarter. CEO Tim Cook further clarified that about 4 percentage points of the 12% total YOY drop in China sales was currency-related.

Second, the blame for the softness can be once again assigned to Hong Kong, since mainland China seems to have performed relatively well. Remember, as discussed in previous quarters, that the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, and therefore carries the burden of the strength of the American currency. Tourism and international shopping in the region gets negatively affected.

Third, notice that inventory shrank in a quarter when mainland China grew, on a constant currency basis, over a F1Q16 that marked Apple's best-ever performance in the country. Therefore, sell-through seems to have been stronger, particularly in mainland, than the numbers suggest. This is usually a sign of strong demand in the market.

Company could outperform soft F2Q17 guidance on easy comps, if currency cooperates

The other area of concern for me was Apple's F2Q17 outlook. Using the mid-point of the range, I calculate that management had guided EPS toward $1.95 for next fiscal quarter (I have adjusted my calculations since yesterday for a positive OI&E charge). This number was significantly lower than consensus' $2.09, and fully offset the $0.14 EPS beat in F1Q17.

However, during the call, CFO Maestri quantified the FX (foreign exchange) impact on the expected results, including $1.2 billion on the top line and 80 bps on gross margins. Armed with those figures, I recalculated what the F2Q17 EPS would have been absent the FX headwinds, which may or not materialize. I then compared those figures to the year-ago results. See table below.

So, to gauge the short-term health of Apple's business, one might need to adjust the soft EPS guidance for FX headwinds. On that basis, earnings should come in 9.5% above last year's EPS, and roughly in line with consensus on a constant-currency basis.

However, since F2Q16 turned out to be such a challenging quarter for Apple as the iPhone business started to deteriorate, next quarter's comps are much easier to beat than F1Q17's. Remember that, in CEO Cook's words, "during the first half of (fiscal 2016) the upgrade rate for the iPhone 6s cycle (was) lower than the accelerated upgrade rate that we saw with iPhone 6 (in fiscal 2015)" So, the bar should be set pretty low in F2Q17 compared to the same quarter last year.

Adjusting Service results for extraordinary items, and a look into 2020

Lastly, let's look at my favorite piece of the investment thesis: the Services segment.

As I have mentioned, the growth rate in this segment in F1Q17 has been the lowest since at least F1Q16. For a business expected to support Apple's growth into the far future, as the installed base continues to expand, I was a bit disappointed with the results.

Source: DM Martins Research, using data from company press releases

But CFO Maestri explained some of the puts and takes:

Our run rate growth was actually higher when taking into account two discrete items. On one hand, the 14th week added to Services revenue this December quarter. On the other hand, that benefit was more than offset by the comparison to the one-off $548 million patent infringement payment included in Services revenue a year ago.

So, let's do a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation: Service revenues of $7.2 billion in the quarter represents about $510 million per week (assuming those revs are not too lumpy within the quarter). The difference between the extra week of sales and the $548 million settlement represents about 0.6% in extra growth YOY, which suggests an "adjusted" growth rate in Services in F1Q17 of 19%. These are not bad results, but still just about tied for the worst quarterly growth rate since F1Q15.

Perhaps more importantly, however, was CEO Cook's disclosure about the long-term expectations:

Our goal is to double the size of our Services business in the next four years.

Looking at the numbers, doubling F4Q16's Service revenues of $6.33 billion in four years would result in $12.65 billion in segment sales by F4Q20. On a quarterly basis, we are looking at 18.9% YOY growth (compounded quarterly) for the next 16 quarters, on average.

Considering that the average growth rate in Services over the past five quarters has been 21.6%, this long-term projection has to be encouraging news. Remember also that Service's margins tend to be higher than total company's, which should be a welcoming offset to the likely dip in the iPhone's profitability over time.

Summary

I continue to believe that AAPL is an excellent buy for the long-term investor. It is true that valuation has expanded over the past 24 hours alone, leaving those that do not own the stock wondering: Is it too late to jump in?

I think AAPL still has legs, especially as a long-term play. Cash repatriation, an imminent dividend increase and a potentially robust iPhone 8 super cycle could send the stock to fresh heights. The installed base continues to grow (reaching well above 1 billion devices now), which bodes very well for Service revenues. On the downside, I don't see many forces pushing shares down significantly, absent sizable macro headwinds or a broad market pullback.

Will Apple Inc. Completely Ditch Qualcomm, Inc. in the iPhone? Analyst Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna (by way of Barron's) recently put out a note suggesting that Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may be able to wrestle away more cellular modem market share from Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) in future Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone models.

By way of background, Apple currently sources cellular modems from both Intel and Qualcomm in its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones. Rolland estimates that Qualcomm has between a 50% and 70% share of iPhone modem shipments, leaving Intel with between 30% and 50%.

The analyst points out that Intel's recently announced XMM 7560 modem supports the CDMA wireless standard, a feature that Intel's previous modems have lacked. Since some wireless carriers require CDMA support, Apple couldn't completely abandon Qualcomm in the iPhone.

"We believe CDMA support was a gating issue in winning the majority of iPhone 7 sockets, as select global carriers require the standard," Rolland writes.

The analyst then says if Apple were to ditch Qualcomm completely in favor of Intel modems, it would lead to a $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion reduction in Qualcomm's revenue and a drop of between $0.25 and $0.35 per share in earnings.

Intel, the analyst says, could stand to see revenue grow by between $800 million and $1.1 billion from such a switch, with earnings per share growing between $0.06 and $0.08.

There's little doubt that having a CDMA-capable modem only helps Intel and hurts Qualcomm as it relates to the iPhone, but I don't think it's realistic to expect Apple to fully ditch Qualcomm. Here's why.

Two suppliers are better than one

There are good reasons to have multiple suppliers for critical components. Having multiple suppliers helps to guard against potential execution problems on the part of a single supplier, such as supply issues and product-quality issues.

To be blunt, Qualcomm's track record with respect to cellular modem advancements is impeccable; Intel's execution, meanwhile, seems to have improved solidly over the years, but it's still not a good idea to bet the iPhone on Intel.

Beyond risk mitigation, though, having multiple competent suppliers in the mix improves the buyer's ability to negotiate prices to its benefit.

Remember, until Intel announced the XMM 7560, Apple essentially had one company from which it could buy CDMA-capable LTE modems -- Qualcomm. So if Apple wanted to sell phones compatible with networks that required CDMA support, it needed to buy chips from Qualcomm -- period.

Moreover, in a recent lawsuit that Apple filed against Qualcomm, the former claims the latter charged Apple a "monopolistic premium" for cellular modems with CDMA support, even though those chips were "in all other respects identical to the chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality enabled."

If Apple had previously had multiple supplier options for CDMA-capable LTE modems, Qualcomm might not have been able to get away with charging such a premium.

So by having both Qualcomm and Intel in the mix supplying modems that are, for all intents and purposes, interchangeable, Apple should be able to lower its component costs and ultimately either boost its gross profit margins or redirect the savings to adding more features to future iPhone models.

Qualcomm may see lower allocation

Though I don't think it's likely for Qualcomm to lose all the iPhone business, I could see Qualcomm's share at Apple come down. Further, I could see Qualcomm's average selling prices of the chips that it does sell to Apple coming down from where they would have otherwise been if Intel weren't on the verge of releasing a CDMA-capable modem.

The situation doesn't look great for Qualcomm, and it looks pretty good for Intel, but in the scheme of both companies' respective consolidated revenues, this just isn't a potential game changer for either one.

Don't Get Too Excited About Apple Manufacturing In India What it must overcome to improve from its overall Asian performance.

Source: Apple

The news Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was moving some of its manufacturing to India garnered a lot of media coverage, as most things announced from the company do, but in the short term, by which I mean the next two to four years, I don't see this having much impact on the performance of the company in its smartphone segment.

That doesn't mean there won't be some growth, because Apple has a very low base point to work from, shipping only 2.5 million iPhones to India last year, according to market researcher Counterpoint, cited by Reuters. Approximately 33 percent of them coming in last quarter.

So far, Apple has only managed to rank 10th in the smartphone market of India, although it has become the leader in the premium smartphone market with 62 percent market share.

There are two immediate factors that are beneficial in general to Apple, but in the near term what really matters to significant growth in the country is held back by competition and problems inherent in India itself. If these can be solved, Apple could make decent inroads into the market.

As it stands, it's far below its goal of selling 10 million phone in India for 2016-17.

Value of manufacturing in India

In order to compete better on price, Apple has decided to go the route of manufacturing within India. It'll do this by eliminating the import duty and having lower labor costs than it does in China.

Apple needs to lower costs because its new models start at over five times what competing models sell for. Lower labor costs and a deal to lower import duties will help to shrink that wide span to more competitive levels.

It will assemble the components of the iPhone SE initially in India, which will immediately remove about 25 percent of the cost difference against competitors, because of its lower asking price.

Apple is asking for India to provide an exemption on its custom duty for 15 years. It is also seeking to continue exemptions on electronic components during that same period of time. It is seeking other exemptions as well, according to the Economic Times.

What Apple needs more than cost cutting

It appears Apple is positioned stronger as a brand in India than China, based upon it leading the premium smartphone segment of the market. But even offering its lowest cost smartphone wasn't enough to meet its projected sales goals, which were about 75 percent below expectations.

That suggests to me that Indian consumers that have the disposable income to do so, will choose an Apple iPhone over its competitors. The obvious problem is there aren't that many consumers able to pay that for the premium phone.

While cutting costs is a good first step for Apple, it doesn't answer the question of how it will differentiate from some of the same competitors it struggles against in China. As mentioned, the Indian consumer with disposable income has a stronger inclination to buy Apple products, but it still must be able to differentiate in a way it justifies the higher costs. It wasn't able to do that successfully in China, and even though it has a stronger brand in India, it must continue to innovate and reinforce that brand to have long-term success there.

Having said all this, the Indian market is different than most other significant markets Apple competes in, and all competitors face the same limitations for meaningful growth.

Conclusion

As Apple continues to seek growth outside of mature markets, it continues to hit its head against cost and branding issues. What made it wildly successful in the U.S. and other developed markets, doesn't work in emerging markets.

Disposable income is part of the issue, but I think that goes hand-in-hand with the competitive advances made by competitors. That has generated questions in the minds of consumers as to why they should pay a higher price for a phone that doesn't have much, if any, more features than other competitors.

I think India may offer a better opportunity for Apple than China, primarily because those with more disposable income favor the brand. That said, Apple is taking the right steps in looking for ways to further shrink the cost between its smartphone and competitors.

The company has been stubbornly resisting really going after the lower end of the market, which makes sense in the West. But not providing another price point other than the premium end of the market makes its growth prospects in India weaker than they otherwise would have been.

Depending upon the Indian economy, Apple may possibly overcome some of the headwinds it faces, but this is going to take a few years to work out, in my view, and while the company focuses on maintaining its premium smartphone strategy, its competitors continue to offer more features at a much lower cost.

I see why Apple continues to resist the mid and low end of the domestic market in the U.S., as most people can choose them if they're committed to the brand. In India and other Asian countries, that's much different.

Even with Apple having the premium smartphone market leadership in India, that represents relatively few buyers when measured against the overall potential of the market. If other competitors, such as those it's already unsuccessfully competing against in China, are able to lower the differentiation value of Apple's brand in India, it's going to struggle to find meaningful growth for its iPhones in the years ahead.

Taking the steps of launching assembly and manufacturing in India is a good step on the pricing side, but it still needs to ensure differentiation in this market is part of its strategy, otherwise it'll fail in its attempt to grow meaningfully in India.

Apple's Chinese Segment Will Come Back Next Quarter Overall, I have much more confidence in my sales/earnings estimates and have no plans of revising lower.

Furthermore, I'm expecting Apple to deliver above the high end of revenue and EPS outlook, given the conservatism of the Q2'17 outlook.

I m anticipating Chinese iPhone shipments of 15.95 million to 18.15 million in the next quarter, which could swing on inventory burn.

Given lean inventory levels and higher levels of interest for iPhone 7/7 Plus in China, there's upside to Apple's financial outlook.

Things are starting to pan out for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in China, which reasserts my bullish argument for a better-than-expected second half, which we will confirm on the next quarterly earnings announcement. I anticipate Apple to topple expectations on revenue/earnings given above-seasonal sell-in for 2H'17, which will result in better-than-expected channel burn over the month of March.

I make this case upon reviewing promising survey data from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BofAML) which indicates Apple has some runway to gain share in mainland China despite weakness in Hong Kong.

The Hong Kong issue has more to do with retail price discrepancy, and so, many in mainland China opt to purchase iPhones whenever they're on vacation in Japan, as opposed to Hong Kong. Currently, Japan has the lowest weighted average retail price for Apple products in Asia.

Since much of the population in China is along the west-eastern corridor, the impact from Japanese sales from traversing Chinese travelers shouldn't be underestimated. Hence, the weakness in Hong Kong gets offset with purchases in the Japanese segment, which is growing at a faster pace than North America (there's a reason for this). So, between the two major Asian economies (China and Japan), the iPhone narrative remains positive on balance for the remaining duration of the year.

How is Apple situated in China?

Given the weak environment in currencies, and some of that abating over the next couple quarters, I believe Chinese mix-shift will help offset the usual quarterly deceleration from a seasonally strong Q1'17.

This implies better-than-expected q/q smartphone shipments, with gross margin likely to report at the very high end of Apple's management outlook range, which is embedded into my Q2'17 sales/earnings model.

(Source: Bank of America Merrill Lynch)

BofAML analyst Wamsi Mohan mentions that Apple iPhone brand ownership share had improved y/y by around 11 percentage points in the months of January-February. The analyst goes on to mention that purchase intentions are supportive of market share gains, though it's not clear where exactly smartphone shipments will be reported between Japan and mainland China.

Here's the direct highlight from his survey report:

Additionally, when asked what type of phone respondents plan to purchase next, 46% said iPhone whereas 39% had intended to purchase Apple next in our January 2016 survey. Interestingly, our January 2016 survey indicated that iPhone would gain 15 points of share of our sample set. Since that survey, Apple iPhone has gained 9 points of respondents' share.

On net, this implies that Apple's smartphone usage share could accelerate to 46%, but what seems more probable is a 6.6 percentage point usage share gain in the forward 12-month span, of which perhaps 3.3 percentage points will be reflected in the next three fiscal quarters, giving me optimism on the Chinese narrative.

Though, Apple's shipment share is much smaller than competing vendors in the region. The installed base ages more gracefully, so Apple's shipment share tends to be more modest in comparison to that of competing handset makers. When running off figures of 563.1 million smartphone users in mainland China at the end of 2016, AAPL's smartphone base sat at 125 million in 2015 and 197 million in 2016 (strictly China), and could expand to approximately 41.6% of the entire Chinese smartphone installed base in CY'17 (based on BofAML's data).

This implies the smartphone base expanded by 72 million between 2015 and 2016. However, due to sampling errors and the skew towards more affluent households in the survey, we would have to readjust the figures to match data with reported actuals.

Furthermore, Apple sells units to Chinese consumers indirectly via its Japanese channel, and furthermore, a decent chunk of the Chinese installed base is composed of used iPhone buyers. This creates significant divergence in reported actuals from the survey data.

(Source: IDC Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker)

When looking at some extra data, Apple's shipments from mainland China amounted to 44.9 million units over 2016. The company reported that Chinese shipment figures were split at approximately 50% new users versus 50% refresh, per Apple's Q1'17 earnings conference call, which implies significant upside in installed base additions over the next three quarters.

However, this year is very different in terms of purchase intent and unit mix in the retail sales channel, which gives me incremental optimism on the Chinese reporting segment. Chinese smartphone shipments are on track for 110 million unit shipments in Q2'17, based on Nomura/IDC figures.

Of course, Apple was under-penetrated in FY'Q1'17, as the company shipped 14.9 million Chinese iPhone units in Q1'17, which compares to 17.1 million Chinese units in Q1'16. The interest among Chinese consumers hasn't dissipated, but rather, Apple is holding back on iPhone 7 Plus replenishment, which will likely reach supply/demand balance in the Q2'17 quarter.

Given what I understand, I expect the company's Chinese market share to reach 16.5% in FY'Q2'17, which compares to 8.6% in Q2'16. Given survey data and channel replenishment, I'm modeling 8 percentage points of market share improvement from the prior year.

This translates to 18.15 million iPhone units in Q2'17 versus 8.6 million in Q2'16. The y/y unit contribution of 10 million from the Chinese mainland will contribute significantly to Apple beating its implied estimate of 53 million iPhone shipments for the next quarter.

I believe Luca Maestri embedded something like 12.72 million units from China in his outlook. When operating off 18.15 million units from mainland China, I anticipate 5.4-5.5 million units to swing above outlook. This means iPhone shipments of 58.3-58.4 million units. Perhaps 1 million unit deceleration happens somewhere else in the world, or it's a matter of channel timing.

If Chinese market share matches that in the Q2'15 quarter, then shipment share would be closer to 14.5%, amounting to 15.95 million units. This would imply iPhone unit shipments of 56.23 million. When averaging both of my prior estimates, I arrive at 57.4 million units or so, which is why I'm reasserting my stance on unit shipments of 57.6 million for the quarter.

Chinese smartphone shipments will likely swing quarterly results, and furthermore, I believe investors are downplaying the Chinese narrative and overemphasizing other areas of the company.

Final thoughts

Expectations on iPhone unit shipments are muted for the duration of FY'17, which is good for investors. Though survey data doesn't give us an exact read into what's likely to happen, the data helps to reinforce my earlier prediction going into the next quarter. I still anticipate Apple to report revenue above consensus expectations at $55.9 billion and EPS of $2.18, which will be driven by Chinese shipment contribution.

Though foreign currencies could diminish upside to estimates, recent trends in currencies are still supportive of revenue/earnings upside. Expect sharp divergence in Chinese shipment trends between FY'16 and FY'17.

I continue to reiterate my high-conviction buy on Apple.

A Valuation Analysis  Apple Working On GST Issue With Indian Government Seems like Apple's manufacturing plant in India will be a go shortly.

Over the weekend, Ajay Kumar, the Secretary of the Indian Ministry of Electronics and IT said, "We are supportive of Apple's proposal (to manufacture in India)," even though a final decision is pending. Beyond devices, Apple Pay will also tie in well with India's move gradually shifting to a less cash economy.

India will soon start to implement a goods and services tax (NYSEMKT:GST) and Apple is seeking a 15 year exemption on duties on imported components which might require a tweaking of the proposed GST structure currently drafted.

The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion stated that they will negotiate a way by tweaking existing GST policy which will not be Apple-specific but will apply to the industry as a whole.

Ajay Kumar added that "We have not reached any decision yet on Apple's demands. But we are hopeful about the discussions that are going on," he said.

Two years ago, Apple had entered into negotiations with the Indian government to set up a manufacturing base in India but were unable to come to an agreement. In fact, India has made significant advancements in its own technological prowess and now offers ample skill-based manpower for companies like Foxconn and Wistron that will be Apple's partners in India.

So get ready for not only Apple iPhones to start making some serious inroads into the immense Indian market but Apple will also be able to aid Prime Minister Modi and the Indian government to make rapid progress in shifting to a cashless economy which is the basis of the demonetisation measures in November 2016.

Could be a win-win for Apple, Apple investors and for the Indian government as well.

Stay tuned.

Apple Inc. Has Big Plans for Its Fast-Growing Services Business Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is primarily a hardware company. Most of its revenue comes from the sale of iPhone, iPad, and Mac products. Beyond those key product categories, the company generates meaningful revenue from its Apple Watch family of smartwatch products, as well as from the various accessories, such as its well-received AirPod line of wireless earbuds.

However, one of the most exciting parts of the company's portfolio is the services business, which the company says "includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare, Apple Pay, licensing and other services."

This segment has been on a robust growth path for quite some time, with revenue here growing 10% in the company's fiscal year 2015, and then a whopping 22% in fiscal year 2016. In the company's most recent quarter, it reported that services revenue was up another 18% year over year.

This isn't a small business, either -- at least in absolute terms. It generated more than $24 billion in the company's last fiscal year, making up more than 10% of the company's consolidated revenue. To really put it into proper perspective, services was Apple's second-largest business by revenue in 2016 -- bigger than the iPad and Mac.

On the company's most recent earnings call, CEO Tim Cook made public the company's vision for services over the next four years, and it's quite ambitious.

Doubling revenue in just four years

"Services are becoming a larger part of our business, and we expect the revenues to be the size of a Fortune 100 company this year," Cook said.

Cook then went on to say that Apple "feel[s] great about this momentum" and that the company aims to "double the size of [its] Services business in the next four years".

Of course, what Apple's goals are and what happens aren't necessarily the same thing, but the fact that management is willing to put a growth figure out there -- a hard number that investors will now hold Apple accountable for -- speaks to the company's confidence.

What would a doubling of this business mean?

Put simply, doubling the business from the revenue levels seen in 2016 would mean that, by 2020, Apple's services business will be bringing in about $48 billion. If Apple can get the business to that scale and then grow it at a modest rate from that point forward (perhaps 5% to 10% annually), then that would do wonders for Apple's longer-term revenue growth prospects.

What's not entirely clear, however, is how that growth will translate into incremental profitability. CFO Luca Maestri said on the call that, on average, the gross profit margin of Services businesses is higher than the corporate average, so an increase in Services mix should help Apple on the gross profit margin front.

That said, as Apple scales up its services revenue, it will likely need to drive up operating expenses associated with the business, as well. While I do expect nice growth in profitability from a boost in services, the incremental gross profit isn't all flowing to the bottom line.

At the end of the day, if Apple hits its growth target with respect to this growing segment, it should be less dependent on the iPhone and could ultimately see earnings multiple expansion as software/services companies tend to be valued more by investors than pure hardware plays.

Comparing Apple Inc.'s A10 With Qualcomm Inc.'s New Snapdragon 835 Chip Website Fudzilla recently noticed that performance results of the recently announced Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 835 mobile processor -- the company's latest chip aimed at premium smartphones -- leaked online.

The site says that the Snapdragon 835 has "left Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) much quoted peak score of 172,644 for its A10 chipset for dead," with a score of 181,434.

I took the opportunity to run the performance test used to compare the two chips -- called AnTuTu -- on my iPhone 7 Plus. And the findings seem to paint the complete opposite picture to what Fudzilla says. The total score my iPhone 7 Plus achieved was 189,105 -- a bit ahead of the supposed results of the new Qualcomm chip.

AnTuTu is a test that's made up of many sub-tests, including 3D graphics, CPU, and "user experience." Let's take a closer look at how the A10 chip inside of the iPhone 7 Plus stacks up against these Snapdragon 835 scores -- if they are, indeed, legitimate.

Apple's CPUs crush Qualcomm's

The A10 contains two sets of custom-designed processors. The "high-performance" cores are called Hurricane while the "high efficiency" cores, which handle less processor intensive tasks, are known as Zephyr.

The Snapdragon 835 uses a similar processor configuration, except it has performance and efficiency clusters, each with four processor cores each. AnandTech says that the cores are "semi-custom" cores based on ARM's Cortex A-series designs tailored specifically for Qualcomm's needs.

According to the leak that Fudzilla references, the Snapdragon 835 scores 10230 in the CPU Mathematics sub-test, 11924 in the CPU Common Use sub-test, and 15705 in the CPU Multi-Core sub-test.

The A10 in my iPhone 7 Plus achieves scores of 19825, 18570, and 14287 in each of these sub-tests, respectively. This means that per-core, Apple's cores are much faster than Qualcomm's, though there are half as many, and in multi-core applications -- ones that can use Apple's two high-performance cores and Qualcomm's four high-performance cores -- Apple's A10 slightly trails the Snapdragon 835.

Snapdragon's graphics lead

The AnTuTu test also includes two 3D graphics sub-tests -- 3D Garden and 3D Marooned. The leak shows that the Snapdragon 835 scores 29499 and 45330 points in these two sub-tests, respectively. The A10, on the other hand, achieves 29353 and 30206 in these sub-tests, respectively.

This suggests that the Snapdragon 835 has a superior graphics sub-system -- not a surprise, as Qualcomm has traditionally been very strong in graphics compared to the co0mpetition.

Apple's leads elsewhere

Finally, in the RAM, which seemingly tests the performance of the memory subsystem of the chip, the Snapdragon 835 apparently gets a score of 10532, while the A10 achieves a score of 12805.

Summing up the "user experience" subtests, the A10 achieves 64059 points; the Snapdragon 835 leak shows a combined score here of 52865.

A10 remains a leadership SoC until the A11 comes along

Although the Snapdragon 835 is more powerful than the Apple A10 in graphics performance, and although it integrates a gigabit LTE modem -- the A10 doesn't include any LTE modem -- the A10 more than holds its own in CPU performance, memory performance, and "user experience" performance as measured by AnTuTu.

This means that buyers of the iPhone 7/7 Plus shouldn't worry about their devices becoming "outdated" from a performance perspective   these will still be best-in-class devices that can hold their own against the many Android-based flagship devices powered by the Snapdragon 835 that are likely to launch in the spring.

And when Apple releases the iPhone 7s/8-series smartphones in the fall, I expect Apple's devices to regain decisive performance leadership in graphics while extending Apple's leadership in CPU performance.

Apple Inc. Likely Isn't Holding Back the 10.5-inch iPad Pro Those Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) customers excited at the prospect of a new, high-end 10.5-inch iPad Pro launching at an event in March were surely disappointed by the release-by-press-release of the new low-cost iPad and updated storage configurations for the low-cost iPhone SE.

At this point, it's not entirely clear when Apple intends to update its flagship iPad Pro lineup. DIGITIMES says that Apple is planning to launch the new iPad Pro at an event next month; a supply chain source told MacRumors that she or he expects a launch "sometime in the spring."

The uncertainty from these sources indicates -- at least to me -- that Apple wants to launch this device as soon as possible and is targeting a spring launch, but something isn't going quite to plan to allow Apple (and, by extension, its supply chain partners) to be able to confidently pin down a more precise launch window.

There's one thing that investors should be confident in amid the uncertainty: that Apple will release the new 10.5-inch iPad as soon as it can. Here's why.

New technology at a faster pace is better

The better that Apple makes its products -- iPhone, iPad, Watch, and everything else -- the more likely it is that customers will be willing to buy them. Apple has the tough task of trying to get current iPad users to try to upgrade to newer models, it wants to capture share from competing tablet makers, and it wants to bring in as many first-time buyers as possible.

The more innovation Apple brings to the table at a quicker pace, the better.

Given that iPad unit shipments continue to be weak (dropping 19% year over year last quarter) and that the company is seeing some average selling price erosion (revenue was down 22% year over year as unit shipments were down "just" 19%), the company desperately needs to take actions to try to reverse these trends.

The low-cost iPad that Apple launched via press release has the potential to help offset the unit shipment declines (introducing solid products at lower price points often has that effect), but that's potentially going to dilute the average selling price story.

Now, diluted average selling prices at higher total revenue levels is OK, but if Apple can put out compelling new products at higher price points, too, then it can not only further improve the unit shipment story but it can also offset that average selling price dilution and drive total revenues (and profits) even higher.

In other words, Apple has real incentive to bring this new technology out as quickly as it reasonably can, so don't expect it to just be "sitting" on a brand-new, ultra-compelling iPad waiting to launch it at the opportune time -- that opportune time is "immediately."

What's the holdup?

It's very likely that the new 10.5-inch iPad is a very complex piece of technology with a lot of bleeding-edge, hard-to-manufacture components. If I had to take a guess at what technology is likely holding up the launch, though, I'd bet on the display.

Remember that Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said a while back that Apple is planning to use a "faster display technology that allows for smoother zooming, panning, and scrolling."

In other words, a high-refresh rate display.

Building a display that can update its contents at a rate faster than the typical 60 times per second is tough, but it's doable. Building such a display at high yield rates with low power consumption and superb image quality is likely another matter entirely.

I think that it's because of Apple's aggressiveness vis-a-vis the new iPad's display technology that the company hasn't launched the device yet and that the schedule is so uncertain.

The silver lining, though, is that once Apple is able to get this new iPad into mass production at good device-level yield rates, it should have a very compelling offering that I suspect could help stimulate upgrade activity, particularly among the more "professional" and "prosumer" types who will really appreciate the higher display refresh rate. Apple, Inc. Likely to Announce Dividend Increase Next Month Ever since Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) initiated its dividend in March 2012, the tech giant has increased its dividend every year in March or April. With the company recently adopting the practice of announcing its annual dividend increase alongside its fiscal-second quarter results, Apple should announce its dividend increase for 2017 next month.

Here's a close look at Apple's dividend, as well as an overview of what investors should expect from this year's increase.

Consistent increases

Apple's dividend increases have been very consistent and predictable. Since Apple initiated its dividend in 2012, management has increased the company's dividend four times. Each time, Apple's annual dividend payments have increased by rates between about 8% and 15%, averaging compound annualized growth of about 11%.

Apple's dividend increases more recently have been very close to the company's compound average during this period. In 2015, Apple increased its dividend by about 11%. In 2016, its dividend increased by 10%.

And if this four-year track record isn't enough for investors to rest assured in management's commitment to dividend increases, management explicitly said in its 2014 press release about its capital return program that it "plans to increase its dividend on an annual basis." Further, Apple said in its update on its capital return program last year that the company would provide investors with an update on the overall program -- including dividends and share repurchases -- "on an annual basis."

Beyond management's promises for ongoing dividend increases, a quick glance at Apple's financials provides the best reason for the company's ability to consistently increase its dividend. Of Apple's annual earnings, the company is only paying out 26.5% of it in dividends, leaving plenty of room for increases. Similarly, of Apple's $52.5 million in free cash flow during the trailing 12 months, the company paid out just $12.3 billion in dividends.

No wonder Apple easily increases its dividend by about 11% annually. And no wonder management isn't afraid to promise dividend increases on an annual basis.

What to expect

Expected to report results for its fiscal second-quarter of 2017 toward the end of April, Apple should announce a dividend increase next month.

There's no reason Apple won't maintain a dividend increase near the 11% compound average growth rate for its dividends it has averaged in the past. But anything between its historical range for annual increases of 8% to 15% wouldn't be surprising.

Investors should also look for Apple to share an update on its overall capital return program, which includes authorized cash to be used for dividends and share repurchases. In April 2016, Apple expanded its authorized amount for its capital return program by $50 billion to a total authorization of $250 billion, with an expiration date of March 2018. Given that Apple had just $49 billion left of this authorization going into its second fiscal quarter of 2017, management will likely either expand its existing capital return program or announce a new authorization. Apple Inc. Watch Series 3 Could Cut the Cord Most of the new product excitement around Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) for 2017 is centered around the iPhone 8. With 2017 being the 10th anniversary of Apple s most critical product, that s understandable. But don t forget the Apple Watch, which is expected to have an update in 2017, too   possibly with a big upgrade.

Source: Apple

After meeting with Apple suppliers in Asia, a semiconductor analyst is now saying the Apple Watch Series 3 will support LTE, making it completely independent of an iPhone connection, even for making voice calls.

Analyst Thinks AAPL is Preparing a Cellular Apple Watch

9To5Mac is reporting that Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland recently toured Asia, meeting with many of Apple s suppliers. Included in that group of companies were wireless communication giants Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ: AVGO ) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ).

Based on the information uncovered during that trip, Rolland feels that AAPL is preparing a cellular Apple Watch and that the Apple Watch Series 3 will feature LTE connectivity:

 We understand a model of the next Apple watch will include a SIM card, and therefore is likely to support LTE. We understand some issues remain, including battery life and form factor size, but significant progress has been made. Apple may be employing VOIP and data across a CAT-M1 connection for superior battery life. Apple will tout interoperability with the company s AirPods. 

Why the Apple Watch Series 3 Would Benefit From LTE

Apple has been working on a solution for cellular connectivity for some time, and was reportedly hoping to offer it as an option with 2016 s Apple Watch Series 2. Battery life concerns appear to have held it back then, but Rolland thinks AAPL has a solution that might work.

Not everyone understands why the company seems so intent on adding LTE to a new Apple Watch in the first place. The answer to that question is independence from the iPhone.

One of the cool features of the Apple Watch from day one was its ability to make and receive cellular phone calls   so long as it was within Bluetooth range of a paired iPhone. There are also many apps running on the Apple Watch that rely on a connection to an iPhone for data.

Adding integrated GPS in 2016 s Apple Watch Series 2 was a big step. It supported fitness enthusiasts in particular, letting them track running distances accurately while leaving the iPhone at home. But an Apple Watch Series 3 with LTE could make that experience significantly better. Apple Watch wearers could take phone calls, send messages, check their Twitter feed, receive notifications and potentially even stream Apple Music.

As pointed out by Rolland, a cellular Apple Watch is also a great selling tool for Apple s AirPod earbuds   whether that s to make voice calls easier, or to listen to music streaming from the smartwatch.

Next Page Analysts Bump Up Price Targets on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Micron Technology, Inc ... Two analysts are getting increasingly bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) as they believe these tech giants are ready to impress. Between Apple delivering the much-awaited iPhone 8 with updated features that are sure to entice consumers and Micron riding NAND and DRAM momentum to likely back-to-back EPS quarterly beats, J.P. Morgan and UBS are lifting price targets with high conviction. Let s dive in:

Apple Dominates Rumor Mill with iPhone Speculation

Apple s flashy new gadget continues to captivate tech enthusiast attention, with every analyst on the Street setting expectations on the illustrious 10th anniversary edition of the iPhone model due this coming fall.

Taking under account  high pent-up replacement demand,  J.P. Morgan analyst Rod Hall has tagged on Apple to his analyst focus list (AFL) while stepping up estimates in a bullish preview of the new iPhone 8 s charged launch.

As such, the analyst reiterates an Overweight rating on shares of AAPL while boosting the price target from $142 to $165, which represents a 17% increase from where the stock is currently trading. Anticipating increased iPhone unit and ASP projections, the analyst subsequently raises his EPS projection to $11.74 for 2018 while adjusting his unit forecast from 245 million to 260 million units for 2018.

Hall elaborates,  We also take a detailed look at OLED supply to Apple and conclude that this should not be a limiting factor but probably will keep Apple from making two OLED models. Multiple iPhone  Pro  features including 3D facial scanning, a glass heavy design, and a structured-light-enabled camera look likely to us and should drive users to upgrade phones that are older, on average, than they have been for four years. 

Ultimately,  New phone features look compelling. Unlike the iPhone7, the new iPhone SKUs look compelling. We believe the high-end OLED  iPhone Pro  is likely to have 3D facial recognition, glass front/back, a structured-light-augmented main camera, a larger screen in a smaller feeling form factor than prior 5.5  models, wireless charging, and a price tag of ~$1,000. We also believe the new 4.7  and 5.5  LCD SKUs are likely to have the all-glass form factor and wireless charging as well,  Hall contends.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, four-star analyst Rod Hall is ranked #1,012 out of 4,554 analysts. Hall has a 48% success rate and earns 6.6% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, Hall gains 14.8% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate AAPL as a Buy. Out of 37 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 29 are bullish on Apple stock, 6 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 9%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $153.07.

Micron Brings Fierce NAND and DRAM Game to the Table

On the heels of Micron s stellar second fiscal quarter performance, UBS analyst Stephen Chin s confidence in the chip giant s success only continues to escalate, as he predicts a series of EPS beats prepare to thunder ahead. With a one-two punch of better NAND and DRAM backing Micron s unfolding velocity, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on MU while upping the price target from $30 to $32, which represents a 10% increase from where the shares last closed.

 Micron guided its May-17 quarterly EPS to $1.50, significantly higher than consensus at $0.90 and one of the biggest guidance beats we have seen in semis since NVIDIA s big beat in its Oct-16 quarter. We keep a Buy rating as we still see the possibility of more EPS beats in its Aug-17 and Nov-17 quarters as new smartphones ramp with possibly higher NAND content. Most of the near term revenue and EPS upside is from higher NAND sales. Micron guided its bit sales of NAND in F2H17 to be up 30% versus F1H17 with most of the upside in this May-17 quarter. We believe this shows strong demand for NAND in the near term. Micron also showed better NAND execution with GM at 31%, up 800bps qoq. Micron s execution in DRAM is also improving with DRAM gross margin at 44%. We believe Micron is making progress closing the wide gap that historically existed between its 2 competitors,  Chin contends.

As usual, we like to include the analyst s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Stephen Chin is ranked #102 out of

TipRanks analytics show MU as a Strong Buy. Based on 18 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 17 rate a Buy on Micron stock while 1 maintains a Hold. The 12-month average price target stands at $35.50, marking a nearly 23% upside from where the stock is currently trading. When Will Apple's Smartglasses Arrive? Rethink Technology business briefs for March 27, 2017.

Apple Accelerates Development of Smartglasses

Source: engadget

According to a report in the Financial Times, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is accelerating development of augmented reality glasses, or smartglasses. It was during Apple's fiscal 2016 Q3 earnings call in July 2016 that CEO Tim Cook uttered the immortal words:

. . . AR can be really great. And we have been and continue to invest a lot in this. We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity.

Since then, there have been numerous reports concerning Apple's development of AR glasses and the FT report is only the latest. At this year's CES, blogger Rober Scoble claimed in a Facebook post that he had talked to an employee of Carl Zeiss AG who confirmed rumors that Zeiss and Apple were working on smartglass technology.

Scoble observed that Zeiss had nothing new to show this year, which he thought might be indicative of Apple-imposed secrecy. The previous year, Zeiss had shown at CES a novel approach to lightweight smartglasses, and this may have attracted the attention of Apple.

While Scoble had predicted that Apple smartglasses could debut this year, the FT report states that a product could be more than a year away. But an important transition appears to have occurred in moving from a lab experiment to a "productization" stage, where engineers and designers work on the final form of the product prior to full scale production.

While Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Hololens endeavors to create the illusion of solid objects embedded in physical reality, most smartglasses simply try to overlay useful information in the wearer's field of view. This information may or may not appear relatively stationary with respect to the wearer's view of the external environment.

Osterhout Design Group showed at CES this year a fairly technologically mature smartglass implementation powered by the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon 835 SOC. One version of ODG's smartglasses, the R-9 is capable of wide screen 1080p stereoscopic display. It has a wide 50 degree field of view and can create the effect of a 1 meter wide TV viewed at a distance of about a meter.

While ODG appears to have solved fundamental problems of creating a widescreen HD display for smartglasses, Apple will probably not go as far as ODG. ODG has essentially built a smartphone into its smartglasses with the use of the Snapdragon 835. It's more likely that Apple will use smartglasses as a display adjunct for iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad. The display information will likely be transmitted wirelessly via a Wi-Fi link between the smartphone and the glasses. In effect, the smartglasses would behave as an Airplay display.

Over short distances, there is surprisingly little lag in this approach. I've been able to play games over Airplay, suggesting that lag was minimal. And Wi-Fi has more than enough bandwidth to support the streaming of stereoscopic 1080p video.

Although the technology is maturing rapidly, FT is probably right about the time frame for product release being 2018. Will smartglasses be Apple's "next big thing"? Probably not, but it may still be very successful. Apple's smartglasses will probably be positioned as an iPhone accessory similar to Apple Watch, but smartglasses could prove much more popular.

If the display capability of the Apple smartglasses proves to be equivalent to what ODG has shown, then Apple will have achieved its true "Apple television." The smartglasses will be equivalent to a large screen HD display that you can carry in your pocket. A major impediment to the Apple television, the need for a "big box" store, will have been eliminated.

Rethink Technology recommends Apple as a buy.

Apple A11 SOC Production to Start in April at TSMC

According to a report from Economic Daily News (via Digitimes), TSMC (NYSE:TSM) is about to start production of Apple's next generation SOC, the A11, on TSMC's new 10 nm process. Digitimes also states that volume production on the 10 nm node started in 2016 Q3, and 10 nm products have already shipped to MediaTek and HiSilicon Technologies.

That Apple is not the first customer to receive 10 nm parts from TSMC is not surprising, since Apple would have preferred to wait as long as possible for TSMC's process to mature. The reported starting time of April is consistent with Apple's usual September release of its new iPhone models. TSMC is expected to produce 50 million A11 SOCs by July. This is needed by contract manufacturers so that they can build up the necessary inventory of completed iPhones in time for the new product launch.

The iPhone 7s and iPhone X are both expected to receive the A11, which will feature lower power consumption and improved performance.

Samsung Gives New Meaning to the Term "Recycling"

Source: Twitter

Following a protest by Greenpeace outside of Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Mobile World Congress press event, the company has announced that it will sell "refurbished" Galaxy Note 7 smartphones. That's right, the very Samsung smartphones that Samsung had to recall because their batteries spontaneously burst into flame.

The company had previously announced that defective phones would be safely disposed of. A representative told TechCrunch:

The objective of introducing refurbished devices is solely to reduce and minimize any environmental impact.

Do you think this is what Greenpeace had in mind? It could be a safe way to "dispose" of the undamaged phones. But Samsung was at pains to make clear that no refurbished phones would be sold in the United States. That's a relief.

NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA) Could Be Circling a Key Revenue Beat, Apple Inc.'s ... When sizing up the bullish cases for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), though NVIDIA is chugging down the tracks full steam ahead, are Apple s glory days starting to dim? Two analysts chime in with divided takes, believing that while NVIDIA stands to hit major upside thanks to a new industry alliance with Tencent and climbing expectations for Nintendo s  Switch,  Apple s advantages are weighed slightly down by mounting causes to be wary. Let s explore:

NVIDIA Robust Growth Speeding Down the Track for Upside

NVIDIA just made two crucial strides forward between adding Chinese internet company Tencent Holdings to its list of clients coupled with buzz surging around Nintendo s  Switch  game console shipments.

With Tencent using the chip giant s GPUs as a public cloud computing service and Nintendo using the giant s parts for  Switch,  top analyst Craig Ellis at B. Riley is out with a bullish take. In reaction, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of NVDA with a $130 price target, which represents a just under 21% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

For Ellis, these exciting developments  further show NVDA s growth story is firmly on track and that material F18&19 estimate upside to RILY s above-Street EPS of $3.62 and $4.50 is increasingly visible. 

 We believe list ASP s are $5k+ and could approach $10k, though volume customers like Tencent would get a meaningful discounts. In this case we suspect AI-based workload appetite spans Tencent s services including texting [ ] on-line [ ] and instant messaging [ ] and exclusive video, gaming, and music content as well as its enterprise service offerings on the Cloud platform. [ ] In RILY s view this interest acceleration augurs well for strong Data Center sales growth and platform revenues which we believe could exceed $1.500B per year in a few years and approach $2.0B or more,  Ellis contends.

Additionally, with Nintendo s Switch  target builds  jumping up from 16 million to 20 million with expectations skyrocketing by 60% to imply 25% upside, NVDA could win big from the gaming front as well. For the analyst,  [ ] we see this as the latest example of product shipments and thus revenue and EPS upside optionality that uniquely exists across NVDA s businesses. 

While it remains early to pinpoint how massively successful Switch will score with the public, the analyst concludes optimistic that at a minimum there could be a prospective $2.457 billion in NVDA Tegra sales revenue, with each $500 million in yearly sales boosting EPS by another $0.40.

Craig Ellis has a very good TipRanks score with a 78% success rate and a high ranking of #33 out of 4,555 analysts. Ellis yields 27.9% in his annual returns. When recommending NVDA, Ellis garners 71.5% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate NVDA as a Buy. Out of 26 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 13 are bullish on NVDA stock, 9 remain sidelined, and 4 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of 8%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $116.45.

Not Downgrading Apple, But 

Though Apple overall has solid free cash flow, a meaningful iPhone 8 launch ahead, and interesting potential in its services segment, FBR analyst Shebly Seyrafi underscores real reasons to be concerned. From Seyrafi s perspective, if investors buy Apple shares, they should buy with eyes wide open alerted to the risks nipping at the tech giant s heels.

Nonetheless, the analyst reiterates an Outperform rating on AAPL with a $155 price target, which represents a just under 9% increase from where the shares last closed.

On a positive note, Seyrafi acknowledges,  Over the past few weeks, many analysts have made positive statements on AAPL noting that it is about to have an iPhone 8  supercycle , services growth continues to be strong, and AAPL is investing in A/R technologies that, leveraging the company s history of innovation, should impress when announced. 

 We get this,  the analyst explains, but adds,  However, after the tremendous run in AAPL since the  Buffett bottom , investors should also be aware of the risks, and there are plenty. 

One risk lies in China, with the users there opting to use domestic brands instead, despite the tech giant s  impressive  reputation.

Ultimately,  These concerns include significant share loss to Oppo, Vivo, and Huawei in China (and we do not see this situation improving anytime soon), challenges in penetrating India (which is 90%+ Android) due to strong competition from leader Samsung as well as very strong momentum by Oppo (up ~16x Y/Y) and Vivo (up over 6x Y/Y), a mature and slowing smartphone market (with mobile phones units expected to grow at only a .9% CAGR between 2016 and 2019), and declining iPhone gross margins,  Seyrafi concludes.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, three-star analyst Shebly Seyrafi is ranked #1,471 out of 4,555 analysts. Seyrafi has a 53% success rate and earns 2.1% in his yearly returns. However, when recommending AAPL, Seyrafi loses 2.4% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics show AAPL as a Buy. Based on 37 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 29 rate a Buy on Apple stock, 6 maintain a Hold, while 2 issue a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $153.07, marking a 7% upside from where the stock is currently trading.

Despite Generous Capital Returns, Apple Inc. Still Has More Cash Than Ever Before Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) overseas cash position continues to grow at an incredible rate, and the possibility of some type of repatriation holiday is the highest it has been in years, thanks to the new Trump administration.

In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, Motley Fool analyst Dylan Lewis and senior technology specialist Evan Niu discuss Apple's cash position and financial structure.

A full transcript follows the video.

This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: Speaking of their international segments, I think it might make sense to check in on their cash hoard a little bit. As of their recent report, Apple is sitting on $246 billion in cash. Because they do so much business outside of the U.S. and because of certain current tax regulations, $230 billion of that total, or roughly 94%, is held outside the U.S. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty asked [CEO] Tim Cook on the call about what the company might be thinking with the current administration, and the possibility of repatriating some of that cash. I think that was a question a lot of people wanted an answer to.

Evan Niu: Yeah. That's one of the big things that the Trump administration is pushing, is this tax reform, including a potential repatriation holiday. If they could bring back a lot of that cash, there are certainly a couple things they could do with it. Cook didn't really give a lot of clear guidance on what he's thinking. But, you could buy some companies. He keep saying that Apple is open to really big acquisitions if they fit, if they make sense, all these things. But he's basically not concerned about pricing anymore. You could buy some companies, you could invest in the U.S., you could potentially bring production back. Obviously, that's another big thing that Trump is pushing.

Another thing I would actually like to see is strengthen the balance sheet. The whole reason they have the $70 billion-plus in debt is because it's always been a way to avoid the repatriation taxes. So, if they can repatriate at appealing rates, it might also make sense to pay down some of that debt, because that way, you can avoid some of the interest expense, and it strengthens your balance sheet a little. Not that the balance sheet is weak, by any stretch of the imagination. It all nets out in the end. But, logistically, it would be nice to bring that money back, pay down some debt. Because, if this is a one-time deal that they can bring back a ton of money, I would expect them to keep generating ridiculous amounts of cash overseas, and then they would want to raise more debt, again, to be able to tap that, in the same way they have been doing, but if they could pay down that debt, that basically gives them even more time to keep pursuing the same strategy. And if they're taking advantage of a one-time tax holiday, I think that would make sense, from a corporate finance standpoint.

Lewis: Yeah. Even with $70 billion in debt, where they had to repatriate a lot of that cash that's held overseas, they still have quite a bit to work with. I think on the call, Huberty specifically asked about what merger and acquisition activity to expect, or if they might continue to invest in original content and programming that would make the Apple ecosystem seem a little bit more appealing. I think because she led with that question and had some specific examples of where cash might go, Cook's response followed along with that. But, I was hoping we might get some color about an increase in the dividend, or an update on what the company was thinking with share repurchase where they'd have that extra capital on hand. But, nothing there at the moment. Cook was notoriously cagey, as always, in his response.

Niu: Yeah. He didn't really give a lot away there. They usually update their capital return program every April. So, next quarter, we will get some insight. They did buy back $11 billion in shares this quarter. Which partially helps juice the earnings-per-share number, which is another record, because they are able to retire so many shares. They retired something like 62 million shares last quarter. That's really highly accretive to that earnings-per-share figure, even though net income was actually down slightly relative to a year ago, in part because of foreign exchange headwinds and things of that nature. So, right now, they are up to about $144 billion in cumulative repurchases, and the current authorization is $175 billion. So they still have plenty of room. They only have one more quarter before they update it again. But I would expect them to give another update and increase it again in a couple months, because this business creates so much cash that they literally have no idea what to do with it. [laughs] I mean, think about how much money they have given back, and the fact that they still have more money now than they've ever had before. So, it's like, they're trying to give this cash back at this ridiculous rate, but they generate so much of it that it still adds on a net basis to their total cash position, even after giving back so much over the years. It's mind-boggling.

Lewis: And that's with them continuing to invest in the future, as well. You hear about some of the different projects that they may or may not be funding, and some of the initiatives they might be pushing. It's not like they're sitting on their heels here. They're certainly throwing money into seeing where tech might be going. It's just that, with this type of money available to them, you can only do so much of it with reinvesting in the business and with R&D. I mean, that's the beauty of having a cash cow business like that.

Niu: It's just insane how much they make. How Apple Inc. Hopes to Grow Its Services Business to $50 Billion by 2020 Services continue to be an increasingly important segment for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), in part due to the recurring nature of the revenue it produces. In this segment from Industry Focus: Tech, the cast discusses how Apple plans to double the size of this business over the next four years.

A full transcript follows the video.

This podcast was recorded on Feb. 3, 2017.

Dylan Lewis: One of the segments that is gaining more and more attention from analysts and the market in general is Apple's services segment. This is the iTunes Store, the App Store, Apple Pay, Apple Music, TV App Store, etc. Services, this time, came in at $7.2 billion, which is roughly 9% of revenue. But, perhaps more impressively, it was up 18% year over year. It seems like the company and the Street are both giving this a little bit more emphasis as time goes on.

Evan Niu: Yeah. And that was a quarterly record, one of those records they set this quarter. If you look at it now on a trailing 12-month basis, services has now crossed $25 billion, in terms of the size of the business. So this is a huge business already. Here's the crazy thing: They're very ambitiously saying they're hoping to double the services business within four years. That's saying, "We think we can make this a $50 billion business by 2020." Which is pretty ambitious. As far as how they'll get there, they highlighted a couple things. First of all, now, there are 150 million paid subscriptions that are being automatically billed, recurring subscriptions. That includes Apple's services as well as third-party services. But that's the total number that is being billed through iTunes and the App Store right now. That's a pretty big number. They do expect that to keep growing. That's a pretty big base of regular subscriptions of various types of services that they sell. Transaction volumes are going up, the installed base is growing. There's really all these different aspects of it. They even mentioned -- this is kind of surprising -- the iCloud storage business is growing quite a bit. I would never have thought it would be a growth driver. But, basically, all these different aspects are really putting up good growth, and combined, they're really bullish about this going forward. It's a pretty ambitious goal there.

Lewis: Yeah. Looking at the inputs of what makes up that services revenue, there's momentum on both sides. Not only is the installed base is getting larger -- so, the number of people that are actually somehow transacting with the services segment -- they indicated in the call that that's increasing in the strong double digits. Also, the ARPU (average revenue per user) for each paying customer is increasing in the double digits. So it's not that one side of that equation is really crushing it and the other one is stagnating. Both sides are performing well. And I think that's what you want to see.

Niu: Yeah. And they also had mentioned the music business, which had been declining for quite some time, for many years. Before Apple got into the streaming side, when it was all the download business for music, as people shifted toward streaming, that business was shrinking. Now, we're back to this inflection point where music is growing again. If you include both download and streaming -- so both iTunes plus Apple Music -- if you combine them, the music business as a whole is now growing again. That's always nice to see, particularly as the shift toward streaming continues, more and more people are willing to pay. The industry itself really likes the shift to paid streaming versus ad-supported streaming. And Apple is a big proponent in that transition. That's also another good sign. They are really helping the music industry grow as a whole, as well as their cut of the whole music business growing again.

Lewis: And you have to like that, considering that they are, what some people might argue, kind of a late entrant into streaming music. You already had Spotify with tens of millions of people using it, and you might have wondered what adoption might have looked like for Apple Music and the streaming service. But results seem to be pretty good so far. Apple: The $1000 iPhone  
2017-01-06
Apple Inc. Earnings: Mark Your Calendar Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will announce the results for its important holiday quarter on Jan. 31, according to an updated schedule on the company's website. Investors will undoubtedly be watching the update closely. Apple's fiscal first quarter of 2017, ending Dec. 31, marked the first full quarter of iPhone 7 and 7 Plus availability. Will the new iPhone help Apple return to revenue growth?

Ahead of the earnings release, here's an early look at some of the key metrics worth looking into.

Revenue

Apple's fiscal 2016 marked a rare year-over-year decline in revenue for the company. Sales during the fiscal year were about $217 billion, down about 8% from Apple's record $234 billion in revenue during fiscal 2015. The company's inability to grow its top line has suppressed the stock's valuation as investors wonder if Apple can grow from here. Apple stock currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14 -- wildly low for an established market leader as dominant as Apple.

Still, some investors may be hoping Apple can either turn revenue around during fiscal 2017 -- or at least put a stop to top-line declines. Investor hope for a return to growth is actually encouraged by Apple management; the company guided for fiscal 2017 first-quarter revenue between $76 and $78 billion, representing a slight uptick from Apple's $75.9 billion of revenue in the year-ago quarter.

Investors may be hoping Samsung's recall of its Note 7 during the holiday quarter will serve as a catalyst for Apple's September-launched iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. With Samsung's flagship smartphones clearly standing out as the biggest competition to Apple's iPhones -- especially in the U.S. -- the Note 7's recall should have helped drive some incremental iPhone sales during the quarter. And since iPhone accounts for about 60% of Apple's total revenue, a solid quarter for iPhone should make a return to growth more likely.

Earnings per share

Another key area to watch will be Apple's earnings per share. But investors shouldn't expect the metric to return to growth the way revenue could. Even if revenue turns upward, Apple is expecting a lower gross profit margin in its first quarter than it sported in the year-ago quarter; a lower gross profit margin on only a slight uptick in revenue would likely mean EPS for the quarter will still be lower than in the year-ago quarter.

Apple said it's expecting a gross profit margin between 38% and 38.5% for its first quarter. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin was 40.1%.

Importantly, as investors digest the quarter's results, investors should keep in mind that even if Apple's EPS declines on a year-over-year basis because of a narrower gross profit margin, worsening profitability will likely mostly be attributable to factors unrelated to Apple's regular operations. In the year-ago quarter, Apple's gross profit margin benefited from a $548 million award for patent infringement. Further, Apple's guidance for a 38% to 38.5% first-quarter gross profit margin takes into account expectations for 60 to 70 basis points of currency headwinds.

Whatever EPS Apple reports, it would likely be worth investors' time to look for an explanation from management about what factors drove EPS higher or lower (probably lower) during the quarter.

For a reference point, the consensus analyst estimates for Apple's revenue and EPS during the quarter are $77.4 billion and $3.22, respectively. This would compare to revenue and EPS of $75.9 billion and $3.28, respectively, in the year-ago quarter.

Apple will release its first-quarter financial results after market close on Jan. 31. The results will be available on the tech giant's investor relations website.

Apple: 4 Realistic Scenarios Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been on quite the tear lately, rising from an almost two-year slump to new record highs, and up virtually 50% over last May's lows. Those lows represented over a year of doubt as sales slumped over the blockbuster year of the iPhone 6/6 Plus that introduced the Plus-sized models, and a rising dollar additionally cut into revenues and margins. Today, however, after a new record in sales and revenues, the story is different.

This brings the price to just over its record of May 2015. Given that the December quarter's figures are just marginally over that of 2015, and that we now are on par price wise, it is a good time to pause and take stock of the situation.

In this article, I examine four likely scenarios for Apple's future. Each has a basic assumption on the company's trajectory that determines the outcome. In a sense, they represent a continuum, but at the same time, are distinct, particularly in their respective premises.

[Yahoo]

Two Unrealistic Scenarios

I will begin with what I believe are two unrealistic scenarios

A. Apple about to fall apart

The story for this scenario gives the following justifications:

A1 - Apple prices are too high and they cannot continue this indefinitely.

A2 - Apple has lost its ability to innovate (helps drive loss of high pricing).

A3 - New players will continue to take market share from Apple with products that are deemed equal in quality but lower in price.

A4 - The slow decline has just begun, and soon sales will fall of the cliff.

This to my mind is not at all realistic. The current quarter shows a return to growth, and the Street is looking to another surge in sales with the upcoming 10-year anniversary iPhone 8 (or "X"?). Furthermore, other revenue drivers (see scenarios 3 and 4) will drive some amount of growth.

Innovation is done at Apple

Many pundits and analysts are driving this meme. I find that those people really do not understand technology on any significant level. They may understand products, but not underlying technology, and so they focus on superficial, visual aspects of the products since they are unable to evaluate anything more profound. I have answered this in detail here: Misunderstanding Apple: The Lost Innovation meme.

Apple is criticized for following other companies which initiate some technology first, but this is frequently a specious argument since the quick-to-market implementation was flawed. The Motorola Atrix had fingerprint recognition, but it did not work well and the model was a flop. Apple came along with a robust and highly secure implementation that worked, but some people said it was not innovation, but copycat.

The same is true of Apple Pay. Sure Google Pay existed before, but Apple waited until the time was right with the Tokenization technology adopted in the banking system, and its own Touch ID/Secure Enclave hardware to secure the transactions. So anyone who believed there was no innovation here was only fooling himself.

B. Apple about to resume exponential growth.

The main drivers for this are:

B1 - The iPhone is returning to growth.

B2 - The iPhone 8 will drive a new surge.

B3 - New products are coming that will be as revolutionary as the iPhone.

This too, is not very probable, although more in the realm of possibility. First, while modest sales growth may be returning to the iPhone, even if the 8 model is a huge success and provides another "blip" in sales, the overwhelming truth is that markets overall are saturating, and the device is in a much more mature phase of the life cycle. Thus, it is unlikely that each new model with be able to present an overwhelming motivation to upgrade as happened when the product was new.

Note - this is not a sign of lack of innovation. It is merely the reality of a more mature product.

Secondly, even if Apple does come out with a wildly significant new product, given Apple's current revenue size, a new product would have to be incredibly enormous to raise revenues by even 50%, let alone double it. (The long misnamed law of large numbers.)

Finally, some revolutionary new product is a cause for concern in this prospect. I am not willing to base investment decisions on mere faith in some such hypothetical future. New products there will likely be, but their success is never assured. For example, the Apple Watch appears to be a modest success, but it hardly is a great driver of growth. I suppose a car would have a large revenue affect, but I will believe that one when I see it.

Four more reasonable views

So we see here two views, one wildly pessimistic and the other the opposite. Let's look at some other more reasonable ones.

Note:

In each case, the points listed for that particular scenario are as well the counterarguments against the other three. They are premises for the argument.

1 - Apple is beginning a slow decline

This scenario mimics the arguments of A above, but less forcefully:

1.1 - Popularity has peaked.

1.2 - Competition in China.

1.3 - All this will result in margin erosion long term.

1.4 - Innovation has ceased.

This scenario acknowledges one of Apple's greatest assets - the ecosystem. It recognizes that Apple makes good, valuable products and has a very loyal customer base.

But, as price competition increases, Apple will inevitably lose. As evidence, is the fact that Apple is losing share in China, one of its main growth areas in the past several years. This will spread with time.

Sales will not fall of a cliff, but revenues will see a slow decline as users see little reason to upgrade often, and slowly begin to desert the overpriced platform.

2 - Apple has reached stasis

This is a further moderation of #1. It states that Apple will not shrink, but neither will it grow significantly after the iPhone 8 release.

2.1 - Competition -> margin erosion.

2.2 - New products will not provide significant additional revenue.

-- Music is already topped out or near.

-- Apple Pay, Apple Watch, have not provided significant growth.

-- Augmented Reality will not be a significant revenue driver.

2.3 - Customer loyalty will hold a steady state of 2-4 year upgrades.

2.4 - Apple is still an innovative company, but limited by the reality of mature technologies.

This recognizes that the iPhone 8 may be another huge success, perhaps as great as the 6 Plus phenomenon, but there is little to drive growth after that. In fact, if the 8 does do really well, then we are likely to see another year of declining sales next year, as numbers face the same "tough comparison" situation that occurred after the 6/6 Plus spurt.

Overall, long term, the future is one of stasis, with little growth.

3 - Apple heading into slow growth

3.1 - iPhone growing again.

3.2 - iPhone 8 should provide a large bump driven by new techs.

3.3 - Services will grow modestly.

3.4 - The dollar will stabilize.

Apple's culture of innovation, design, and quality build will always keep it on top. Its smooth ecosystem will keep customers happy, and secure margins.

On the other hand, current technologies limit somewhat the potential for serious growth. There is no Apple Car coming (at least not in the immediate future), and AR may drive some growth, but that and other services will be limited.

There could be a strong surge in iPhone 8 sales, but after that, growth will be very modest. Services will also provide growth, but even if you were to add all of Netflix's (NASDAQ:NFLX) annual revenue (roughly $9B) that would only add 4% to current TTM revenue.

This scenario also suggests that the dollar will stabilize near its current level and not further reduce revenues in year-over-year comparisons.

4 - Apple moving back to moderate sustained growth

This scenario takes #3 a bit farther. The premise is that many of the negative factors of the previous year and a half are behind us.

4.1 - iPhone 8 will draw many new users.

4.2 - Services revenue will grow significantly.

4.3 - Apple watch v3 solves many issues and takes off.

4.4 - Mac and iPad resume modest growth.

The premise of 4.1 is based on reports that the new phone, the tenth anniversary model, will be a significant upgrade, including major design factors. Additionally:

a. Long battery life will be a huge winner, as has been proposed by KGI's Ming-Chi Kuo . He suggested that a significantly larger battery will be used. This combined with a more efficient processor and the reduced consumption of an OLED screen, and all together they could increase battery life by as much as 80%. This is a very large pain point for many users that would be removed.

b. The introduction of a good Augmented Reality system might be enormously popular. Tim Cook has been saying that AR is a huge development. If the idea is to make the 10th anniversary iPhone a celebratory model, then one would expect some kind of revolutionary new functionality. I imagine that Apple would offer some kind of AR app, but also a developer's platform. If so, this should be announced at the WWDC in June.

This year the Apple Watch will see its third iteration. There is speculation that it will feature LTE cellular connectivity. This and increased functionality that comes with a next generation processor could move it out of the niche category into more widespread adoption. Over time it could add a significant amount of revenue. We should remember that both the iPod and the iPhone grew slowly at first. We do not know precisely what watch sales are, but I can imagine they are a significant business to anyone but Apple.

The Mac has turned the corner. For a year it saw declining sales, but this past quarter, it returned with positive year-over-year growth, and a new record revenue. Undoubtedly, this was due to the new MacBook Pro model, a significant update with the Touch Bar technology.

While the iPad sales continue to slide, the rate of year-over-year decline is lowering. It is not likely that the iPad is going to disappear, so at some point, it will cease the decline, and potentially return to growth, however modest. The current iPad Pro has a power that matches that of most laptops. The next generation A11 processor could put it ahead of some more high-end models.

New products

There is always room for some new product that would add modestly to revenue.

Personally, I still believe that sooner or later, Apple will announce a low-end Mac based on its A-series processors. An under-$400 desktop would add a huge number of new customers. This, however, is highly speculative.

If this scenario plays out, then Apple would return to significant growth. While not the enormous growth of the early iPhone days, it would be significant, perhaps in the low teens percentage wise.

Summary

We have presented four likely scenarios and seen how each one follows from a given set of premises about Apple's business and the consumer base. The investor should think about them and decide which set of premises seems most reasonable, and from there can decide an investment strategy.

Of course, growth is not the only measure for a stock value. Previously, I discussed the value of Apple's stock repurchase program, and how it has effected EPS. In a future article, I will discuss Apple from a dividends perspective.

But other things affect any company's revenue stream, many of these external political and economic developments. This year there is a lot of uncertainty in these areas, and Apple's fortunes could be changed.

On the positive side, a lowering of taxes on repatriation of foreign earnings could be a large positive by making it economically feasible for Apple to bring some of its huge cash hoard back into the U.S.

On the other hand, there are some significant risks as well. The current President has said he has some radical plans for bringing jabs back to America. This is well and good, and an improved economy at home would be good for sales. But some of the policies could potentially lead to trade wars with various currently close partners. This would likely result in at least some period of chaos in which trade would be negatively affected, and could possible lead to very high barriers that would cut Apple sales short.

Already presidential actions have had unanticipated consequences. The immigration ban from seven countries has galvanized unexpected opposition. More importantly, it stranded many legal workers away from their work and families. There is even evidence that the trade ban has seriously curtailed tourist and business travel to the U.S., and that this could cost thousands of jobs. It is said that just the talks of a border tax has disrupted the Texas cattle market.

Rash and hasty implementation of changes in trade agreements could have a devastating effect on all areas of the U.S. and global economies. While we hope this does not happen, it certainly is a possibility that needs to be considered.

Much has been said as of late about Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A, BRK.B recent buying of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) - see here, here, and here) - many investors and commentators are surprised by Uncle Warren's Berkshire investment in Apple. What's more, it seems to go against his "no tech stock" mantra.

In this article we will see that by applying Berkshire Hathaway's own investment framework, buying Apple isn't such a stretch. What's more, upon further reflection, Apple appears to be a classical Buffett-type investment.

Tech Aversion

Just prior to the bursting of the 1999 internet bubble, Warren Buffett wrote an article that was published in Fortune Magazine that outlined his thesis for sitting on the sidelines. Essentially, it boils down to the following points:

Investor expectations for the "information revolution" of the internet were high, based on the revolutionary effect the internet would have on all facets of our lives.

With such high expectations came extraordinary stock valuations that were based on future events that had yet to materialize.

It was not possible, based on the information at hand, to successfully predict the winners from the losers.

Many of these internet companies had no identifiable competitive advantage (MOAT).

Buffett goes on to cite the automotive and airline industries as examples, which also revolutionized society but led to poor investor returns. Interestingly, at present, Berkshire has investments in both sectors, but that is a topic for another day.

Berkshire seemed to change its mind with IBM (NYSE:IBM) in 2011, and in 2016, with its subsequent purchase of Apple.

What has changed since Buffett first expressed his apprehension of tech stocks in 1999?

The Four Pillars of Berkshire's Investments.

In 2012, Charlie Munger gave an interview to BBC in which he discussed a wide range of topics. Of those topics discussed also commented on the four criteria him and Warren employ when thinking about investing in a business. In summary, they are:

1) We have to deal with what we are capable of understanding.

2) We look for businesses that have a durable competitive advantage.

3) We prefer a management with integrity and talent.

4) We need to pay a price that makes sense and gives us a margin of safety.

Given this, let's drill deeper into Apple.

Capable of Understanding the Business?

For most of you reading this, I don't need to tell you how Apple makes its money. Essentially, it's a consumer electronic hardware company with the majority of its revenue coming from sales of the iPhone.

Source: Apple Q1 2017 Earnings Release

What is talked about less is the services component of Apple. Currently accounting for 13% of revenue, basically, this is the revenue generated from services provided by the App Store, Apple Pay and Apple music. The revenue generated is high margin and is rapidly growing (18% year over year, as shown above)

In essence, Apple sells you a hardware product and then uses its ecosystem of services to generate recurring revenue as you use the hardware product. I think most would agree they are capable of understanding the business.

Durable Competitive Advantage?

There is no doubt that the consumer electronics space is a fiercely competitive space - if you don't destroy your own product by updating it and releasing a new version on a frequent basis, you can be sure one of your competitors will. Furthermore, one could think of consumer electronics as a commodity - generally consumers go where they get the most bang for their buck and so often the lowest cost producer will win.

How does a company build a moat in this space? The first way is via brand. I think Apple has done a great job building its brand as consumers often associate the brand with quality, design and innovation. Many Apple users are fiercely loyal to the company to the point where they sometimes become borderline annoying. Furthermore, the brand is also considered a premium product, one that confers wealth and status. Brand strength allows Apple to charge higher prices and enjoy higher margins for its "premium" product.

The astute reader will point out that margins have come under fire as of late, which implies consumers are willing to pay less of a premium. This suggests the brand moat is eroding.

Despite this, Apple has another trick up its sleeve - its services. Its services not only provide attractive business economics (low capital requirements; high margins), but they also create a switching cost for the consumer. Think about it - if you are familiar and comfortable with the App Store, subscribe to iCloud for data storage, have an Apple Music subscription, and use Apple Car Play in your daily driver, how likely are you to switch from an iPhone to an Android phone with your next purchase?

As hardware sales continue, more consumers use Apple services (driving service revenue growth) and in turn the Apple products work their way into your life. What's more, the more Apple products you use, the more these services harmonize across different platforms and the switching costs increase. Finally, the more hardware Apple sells, the greater the incentive for developers and third parties to create software for that hardware (i.e. downloadable apps via the App Store), which in turn creates greater incentive for consumers to buy the product. This virtuous cycle creates a network effect.

We can see these moats in action by looking at the historical trends of earnings growth and cash flow growth at Apple - over the last 10 years, earnings have grown 28%. This is fairly impressive, considering the cutthroat nature of the consumer electronics business.

Source: FASTGraphs

It is also important to recognize that cash flow has also been growing as well, averaging just shy of 25% over the last 10 years.

Source: FASTGraphs

The astute reader will recognize that buybacks do contribute to earnings per share/cash flow per share growth. This is true, and will be discussed more below.

Thus I believe, qualitatively and quantitatively, that Apple does have a durable competitive advantage. Moreover, as long as service revenue continues to grow this moat is increasing with time.

Does Management Have Integrity and Talent?

Admittedly, this is the most difficult question for investors to answer, as you need an understanding of the managers as people to come to a conclusion. As I do not know Tim Cook, or any of the directors personally and because I am not privy to the inside workings of Apple, I must take a different approach to answering this question.

As owners of the business, investors look for stewards that act in their best interest - I would say this constitutes integrity. One way to assess this would be to examine how shareholder friendly Apple's management is. At present, Apple does pay a small dividend (currently yielding 1.4% at the time of writing) which is relatively new as it was instituted in 2012. Although young, this dividend has grown by just over 40% over the last 5 years, which is quite impressive dividend growth.

Additionally, Apple does have a buyback program, spending $144 billion on share repurchases since 2012.

Source: Apple Return of Capital Timeline Q1 2017

Management also has an eye for value when doing buybacks, as buybacks are really only value creating for shareholders if the shares are bought back while undervalued - in essence, management is buying $1.00 for less than $1.00. Alternatively, when a stock is overvalued and management initiates a buyback, management destroys value as it buys $1.00 for more than $1.00. Apple has a history of being opportunistic and acting swiftly when management views its shares as being undervalued.

Overall, these substantial buybacks have also led to a significant decrease in the total share count outstanding. Said another way, each investor's piece of the pie is increasing, thanks to management.

Source: YCharts

Of note is that Apple also has $246 billion in cash on the books, with ~$230 billion held in overseas, tax sheltered accounts. Any repatriation of these funds could lead to a substantial value creation event for shareholders.

Does management have talent? I think the easiest way to assess this is to examine how management is incentivized and see if they met these incentives, as a strong business can compensate for a poor manager.

After failing to meet internal 2016 goals, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, made ~20% less than he made in 2015. This failure of execution so far appears to be a one-off event, but nonetheless it bears discussing.

Thus, I think management has integrity and very likely has talent.

Price That Makes Sense, with a Margin of Safety?

This, in essence, is the valuation of Apple - as Munger says in the interview above, a wonderful company is not worth an infinite price. Using S&P Capital IQ data, a DCF yields a fair price of about $125.

From a multiple point of view, today Apple is trading at a P/E multiple of 16.22 which is at about its 10-year median of 15.38. This equates to a present earnings yield of about 6%.

From a cash flow perspective, today Apple is trading at a P/FCF multiple of 14, which is also close to its 10-year median of 12.61. This equates to a present free cash flow yield of 7%.

It is worth mentioning that Berkshire first purchased Apple shares in May of 2016, and Apple shares have appreciated by about 30% since then. The second addition - when Berkshire quadrupled its position - presumably occurred somewhere between share prices of $100-$120, in which case, Apple shares would have been slightly undervalued to fully valued. I think this purchase price makes sense, although at first glance, I do not think there is a meaningful margin of safety at these levels.

However, thinking about it more, the cash on the books accounts for about ~34% of the market cap of Apple. Perhaps this is Berkshire Hathaway's margin of safety, as this money does not generate any meaningful return for Apple or its shareholders by sitting in the bank. Said another way, if you were to buy the whole company and somehow unlock the cash in the bank, you would immediately get just over 1/3 of your money back, without having to rely on the continued operations of the company. Perhaps this is Berkshire Hathaway's margin of safety.

Putting It All Together

Thus, we can see that since Buffett wrote on tech stocks in 1999, things have changed. Apple has an easily understandable business model that has historically shown to be a winner. It can be valued based on fundamentals. It has a moat that is increasing with time. It has a management in place that appears competent with integrity.

Furthermore, the company is a cash flow machine with a ridiculous amount of cash on the books (~$46/share) that, if unlocked, would generate a tremendous return for shareholders.

Given this, with the power of hindsight, it appears that Berkshire's investment in Apple is a no-brainer.

Please feel free to let me know what you think about Berkshire's investment in Apple in the comments section below.

The secret to the success of Vivo and Oppo may have been the People's Republic of China government.

Research firms Canalys and Counterpoint have concluded that Apple fell to fifth place in unit percent share of the China smartphone market in 2016. No, this article isn't about market share but about fair competition. Two of the Chinese brands that leapt out in front of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in 2016, Vivo and Oppo, are actually owned by the same company, BBK Electronics, which also makes the OnePlus smartphone. And there are indications that BBK is a state-owned enterprise of the People's Republic.

Source: iDesignArch

Documenting the Impact

According to Canalys, the China smartphone market grew at a robust 11.4% to 476.4 million unit shipments in 2016. Huawei, Oppo, and Vivo grew the most of the top five smartphone brands.

Counterpoint's research roughly agrees with the Canalys results, although Counterpoint puts Apple just 5 tenths of a percent behind Xiaomi in market share for 2016.

Counterpoint provides a good summary chart of the y/y declines in share for the top brands:

Oppo and Vivo were stellar performers in y/y market share gain, and according to Counterpoint, the Oppo R9 displaced the Apple iPhone (6s) as the top-selling smartphone model in 2016. Although it's not widely known, it's no secret either that both Oppo and Vivo are subsidiaries of BBK Electronics.

Following the Links

Figuring out who owns BBK takes a little more doing. According to Bloomberg, BBK Electronics Corp. Ltd. is privately held and is located at:

126 Bubugao Road

Wusha Village Chang'an Town

Dongguan, 523860

China

However, there are indications that BBK is not private. The site phoneradar.com has an extensive history of the company and compares BBK to the Volkswagen Group (OTCPK:VLKAY) with its multiple auto brands. There appear to have been attempts in the past to obfuscate ownership links between the BBK parent and its subsidiaries.

For instance, OnePlus was founded by an ex-employee of Oppo, Pete Lau. While initially denying a link to Oppo, government documentation eventually revealed that OnePlus is a wholly owned subsidiary of Oppo, according to phoneradar.

The Internet Archive has an archived page from an official People's Government of Chang'an Town web page that described BBK in 2012:

BBK (OPPO) is a leading enterprise in Chinese electronic information industry with headquarters and production base set in Chang'an. It is the highest taxpayer of Chang'an. Established in September 1995, the company covers more than 10 hectares of factory buildings and has more than 17,000 employees. The company has two branches and one subsidiary. BBK Educational Electronic Company mainly specializes in research, production and sale of educational electronic product such as learning machines, language repeaters, electronic dictionary, reading machines, etc. BBK Communication Technology Company mainly conducts research and development, production and sale of communication technology product including music mobile phone, cordless and corded phones, etc. Guangdong OPPO Mobile Communication Technology Co., Ltd specializes in research and development, production and sale of smart mobile phone, digital player including OPPO mobile phone, mp3, mp4 and electronic book, etc. BBK (including OPPO) achieved sales worth 9.3 billion yuan.

An article in VRWorld in 2014 claimed that BBK is a state-owned enterprise and cited this web page as proof. On the page (which is current, not archived) is a description of Guandong BBK Electronics Industry Co., Ltd., which is very much like the description above:

On September 18, 1995, Guangdong BBK Electronics Industry Co., Ltd was established in Changan Town, Dongguan City. In this fertile place, industrial infrastructure is complete, industry supporting system is perfect. In the local government support and assistance, and through more than ten years of sustained development, BBK company stand out from the same industry and has become a development model of contemporary Chinese home electronics enterprises. BBK brand now has four series of products: audio-visual products (DVD, Mobile DVD, mini-component systems, etc.), communications products (music, mobile phones, corded phones, cordless phones, digital cordless phones, etc.), education, electronic products (@ ibox learning machines, electronic dictionary, point of time machine, business learning machine, repeat, etc.), life electrical appliances (cooker, electric pressure cooker, soybean milk machine, electric kettle, etc.).

A little further down the page, Guangdong BBK Electronics Industry Co., Ltd. is listed as a state-owned enterprise. One can well believe that this is a state-owned enterprise from the glowing, Great Leap Forward, descriptions. Get out your Little Red Books.

Investor Takeaway

Of course, I can't conclusively prove that Guangdong BBK Electronics Industry Co., Ltd. and BBK Electronics Corp. Ltd. are one and the same entity. It could all just be coincidence. Or perhaps the state-owned enterprise was privatized at some point, but this interpretation is contradicted by the current listing of Guandong BBK cited above. Even if BBK has been privatized, it could still have very strong links to the PRC government, and those links could be convertible into all sorts of business advantages.

Even though the evidence is circumstantial, my interpretation is that the meteoric rise of Oppo and Vivo is not mere good fortune, but the product of intervention by the PRC. I guess it shouldn't come as a complete surprise that Communism lives on in the People's Republic.

This creates a multifold problem for Apple. On the one hand, it very definitely calls into question future growth expectations in Greater China (PRC, Taiwan, Hong Kong). If Apple has to compete against state-supported enterprises, is this really fair? These enterprises don't necessarily have to make a profit.

On the other hand, state enterprises historically don't compete well against independent businesses over the long run, even with state support. There's still hope that Apple can resume growing in China by fielding superior products.

The other, perhaps more pressing impact is that this could provide grist for the protectionist mill in the Trump Administration. This is exactly the kind of pretext that could work to sell a "border tax," which is currently under consideration in Congress. I continue to regard such tariffs (let's call them what they are) as counterproductive.

In its December quarter, Apple demonstrated that it could still grow revenue overall by 3% y/y, even though revenue in Greater China declined 12% y/y. So I don't regard China as a make or break for Apple. Apple is a global company in the best sense of the word. I'm more worried about the prospects for a trade war with China, which could definitely hurt Apple in the near term. Despite this potential headwind, I continue to be long Apple and recommend it as a buy.

Are Apple Investors Too Optimistic?  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Roars To Another High, iPhone Data Points Strong Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock is up more than 20% year to date and climbed to yet another record closing high on Thursday, ending the day at $140.69 to beat the last closing high set earlier in the week. Investors seem cheered by Wall Street s promises about the iPhone 8, and now some fresh data on iPhone sales suggests better-than-seasonal activity. Analysts also cheered the prospect of a cash repatriation holiday and its potential impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL).

Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price target boosted

Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves raised his bull-case price target for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock to $175 per share based on the prospect of a cash repatriation holiday. This is a common song on Wall Street these days, as is the iPhone 8. Despite the increase in his bull case, the analyst left his base case for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock the same at $140 per share.

If President Trump manages to deliver on his campaign promise of a tax holiday for cash repatriation, Hargreaves estimates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) could add $204 billion to its cash stash in the U.S., bringing it to $220 billion. He adds that bringing all that cash home without paying hefty taxes on it could enable the iPhone maker to  comfortably double or triple its regular dividend and still make a meaningful acquisition without impairing its balance sheet. 

That would bring its current dividend of $2.28 per share to $4.56 per share if it s doubled, and a dividend increase could provide support for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock if the iPhone 8 cycle doesn t turn out to be as great as analysts have been gushing about. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock has been setting more and more record highs, Hargreaves and a few other analysts have begun to caution investors about expecting too much from this year s iPhones.

Solid iPhone supply chain data

In a research note dated March 15, Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski reiterated her Buy rating and $150 price target on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock and released fresh supply chain data on the iPhone and also some sales data points from China. She said supply chain data points to higher-than-usual seasonality in February based on average sales from six of the company s suppliers.

The suppliers reported a 27% year over year increase in sales, on average. Month over month, the average decline was 18%, but that was much better than the three-year average decline of 34%. Jankowski continues to project 52.8 million iPhone units for the March quarter, which is ahead of the consensus a 52.1 million. She added that even her estimate could be low if the higher-than-seasonal supply chain trends continue.

China shipments are also strong

Apple Inc. (AAPL) is also showing strength in China, a key market where it has been struggling for about the last year Jankowski said that data from China s Ministry of Industry and Information indicates that smartphone shipments during the first two months of this year rose 12% year over year to 72.8 million. She added that Android smartphone shipments rose only 5% year over year, while non-Android smartphone shipments jumped 50% to 14.5 million.

She feels that this could mean iPhone shipments in China have recovered because iPhones make up most of the non-Android shipments. If she s correct, it means Apple Inc. (AAPL) didn t need the iPhone 8 to spur growth there after all.

Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock edged downward by as much as 0.11% to $140.54 during regular trading hours on Friday. Apple Inc. To Invest More In China As iPhone Sales Slow Apple s iPhone sales growth has somewhat slowed in international markets, especially in India and China because of competition from local players. Now, to improve its performance, at least in China, the tech giant is planning to set up two more research and development centers and boost investments in the region.

Pledging more money to China

The two new Chinese research hubs are being planned in the eastern Chinese cities of Shanghai and Suzhou. China, Apple s largest overseas market, already has two Apple research centers slated for Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen. The tech company has promised to spend about $507 million (3.5 billion yuan) on R&D institutions as well.

According to a statement on Apple s China website, all four research centers are slated to open later this year. The tech giant hopes to attract local talent and graduates from local universities to work in the research centers. In its press release, the company noted that these four R&D centers will also help it cooperate better with its local partners.

The announcement about two more research centers comes as CEO Tim Cook undertakes his most recent trip to China over the weekend to attend a high-profile business conference in Beijing. In this conference, senior government officials will communicate with the heads of some of the biggest corporations in the world, like Saudi Arabian Oil Co. and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, notes Bloomberg.

Apple needs to beat local players

China has always proven to be the most challenging market for the Cupertino-based company, as the country has many rising local smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, etc. Smartphones from these local players are not only low-priced but also come with comparable (if not better) features.

This announcement by the tech giant comes at a time when iPhone shipments declined for the first time in China on a yearly basis in 2016. Greater China revenues dropped 12% year over year in the quarter ending on December 31. Local smartphone makers like Oppo, Vivo and Huawei Technologies are eating away Apple s market share in China with high-end and low-priced devices.

Apple has no option but to overcome this competition, and it is using its money to do that. This will not only help it win favors from the government but will also allow it to tap local resources.

On Thursday, Apple shares closed up 0.16% at $140.69. Year to date, the stock is up more than 21%, while in the last year, it is up almost 38%.

Apple Inc. Stock Heading To $155 With iPhone 8: Analyst The iPhone 8 could be a  powder keg  for Apple stock, according to one analyst who continues to espouse the super cycle thesis for the shares. It s pretty much the same, old song and dance, but with a price target increase this time.

Cowen boosts Apple stock price target to $155

In a research note, Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri said he increased his price target for Apple stock to $155 from $135 due to the expected launch of the iPhone 8 in the fall. He still sees room in the stock s multiple and feels that estimates for the iPhone maker s results this year still have to go up a lot. For the three new models expected this year, including the iPhone 7s, iPhone 7s Plus and iPhone 8, he estimates total units of about 110 million for 2017.

Of that total, he believes about 55 million to 60 million will be the rumored 5.8-inch OLED display iPhone 8. He s projecting 20 million to 25 million to be the iPhone 7s Plus and 35 million to 40 million to be the iPhone 7s.

Believing the iPhone 8 rumors

The analyst pretty much believes all the rumors regarding the iPhone 8, as he s expecting it to feature an edge-to-edge 5.8-inch display with new function buttons and no physical Home button. He feels that other potential updates to the iPhone 8 could be facial recognition technology and wireless charging, probably using Broadcom s components.

He also said in his report that Apple is attempting to implement its new Touch ID technology under the display. He claims that the company wants to use technology developed by AuthenTec, which it acquired in 2012, but it s  open to other options.  He added that the iPhone 8 will probably be the only one of this year s three new models to feature facial and gesture recognition, although he expects the iPhone 8 and iPhone 7s Plus to both have dual-lens cameras.

iPhone 7 line also supporting Apple stock

But the iPhone 8 isn t the only reason Arcuri raised his price target for Apple stock. He also said the iPhone 7 lineup continues to sell well, backing up reports from other analysts. Arcuri raised his iPhone unit estimate for the March quarter based on his supply chain checks. He now expects the company to ship 50.5 million iPhones during the March quarter. He pegs the average selling price for the iPhone during the quarter at $685.

Shares of Apple stock closed up 1.04% at $141.05 on Monday. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Should Address Diversification Concerns to Shore Up AAA ... By Nicholas McCullum

There are currently two companies to hold the coveted AAA credit rating from Standard & Poor s:

Johnson & Johnson

Microsoft

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been speculated by many to be the next company to hold this perfect credit rating.

The technology giant has strong free cash flows, a loyal consumer base, and one of the most impressive balance sheets that I have ever seen.

However, the AAA credit rating is notoriously difficult to achieve. It would imply that Apple is considered more creditworthy than the U.S. federal government and all but 15 states. Each of these sovereign entities has the ability to tax their citizens.

This article will discuss the possibility of Apple earning the next AAA credit rating from S&P.

Apple Business Overview

Apple needs little introduction for most investors. This large technology company is best known for their popular iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and iTunes Store.

The company is divided into five segments for reporting purposes:

iPhone (69% of 1Q2017 revenues)

iPad (7% of 1Q2017 revenues)

Mac (9% of 1Q2017 revenues)

Services (9% of 1Q2017 revenues)

Other Products (5% of 1Q2017 revenues)

Because of the popularity of its products, Apple has grown to be the largest company in the United States based on its market capitalization of ~$735 billion.

Apple has also shown impressive profitability. Apple s fiscal year 2015 and 2016 were the 3rd and 5th most profitable years by any company in history, respectively.

The  Mother of All Balance Sheets 

 Our financial position has never been stronger. We [have] the mother of all balance sheets.    Apple CEO Tim Cook on a company conference call

Apple s balance sheet has been discussed in detail by its investors and is one of the main reasons why the company is speculated to hold the next AAA rating.

As of 1Q2017, Apple reported the following:

$16.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents

$44.1 billion of short-term marketable securities

$14.1 billion of accounts receivable

$185.6 billion (!!!) of long-term marketable securities

Apple investors should note that the majority of Apple s cash hoard lies overseas. On page 55 of Apple s most recent 10-K, the company wrote:

 As of September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, $216.0 billion and $186.9 billion , respectively, of the Company s cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries and are generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the U.S. 

Adding up the company s current cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities (both short-term and long-term) gives a figure of $246.1 billion. So while the numbers were not reported at the same time (September versus December), we can estimate that ~88% of Apple s liquid capital is tied up overseas.

To use this capital domestically, Apple must  repatriate  these funds, which means to transfer the money to domestic accounts.

When a repatriation event occurs, the company must pay the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35%, with a credit applied for any international taxes already paid.

Luckily for Apple (and its investors), the company may soon have an opportunity to repatriate its international capital at a lower tax rate.

The new Presidential administration has been quite vocal about the possibility of a repatriation tax holiday. Companies could bring back overseas capital at a temporarily reduced tax rate of 10%.

For some context, the last repatriation tax holiday occurred under the Bush administration at a rate of 5.25%   and 843 companies returned more than $300 billion of capital to the United States.

Regardless of the precise details, Apple would benefit greatly from repatriation tax reform.

In the meanwhile, Apple has been issuing long-term debt at attractive interest rates to fund domestic purchases. This has included dividends and stock repurchases, both traits of shareholder-friendly stocks.

Apple s long-term debt has been increasing over time in recent years as a result of this capital allocation strategy.

The company s long-term debt is compared to Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft in the following diagram.

Source: Value Line

Apple has more debt than the other companies in this peer group.

However, this is not really relevant   Apple is also the largest company in the peer group, so more debt would be expected (all else being equal).

Investors are better off comparing the company s leverage metrics.

The ratio of Apple s long-term debt to shareholders  equity to compared to Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft below.

From the chart, it can be concluded that:

For every $1.00 of Johnson & Johnson s balance sheet that is financed with shareholders  equity, there is $0.32 financed with long-term debt.

For every $1.00 of Microsoft s balance sheet that is financed with shareholders  equity, there is $0.57 financed with long-term debt.

For every $1.00 of Apple s balance sheet that is financed with shareholders  equity, there is $0.59 financed with long-term debt.

While Apple s leverage ratio is the highest in the peer group, it is only by a very narrow margin.

Combining this with the company s massive cash pile (and a potential tax repatriation holiday for Apple s overseas cash) leads me to believe that Apple s balance sheet is not holding them back from achieving a perfect credit score.

Rather, I suspect the cause is the company s earnings mix.

Diversification Concerns

Apple s earnings mix is not ideal for the company s shareholders, despite the company s impressive bottom line growth over the past decade.

Adjusted earnings-per-share growth from $0.32 in 2006 to $8.31 in 2016 represents a 10-year CAGR of 38%. This has been very rewarding for Apple s shareholders.

However, Apple currently generates the vast majority of its profits from iPhone sales.

Source: Apple First Quarter Earnings Presentation

In it s most recent quarter, Apple reported $54.4 billion in revenue generated from it s iPhone segment alone.

This is not ideal. While many would say that the iPhone is objectively one of the best smartphones on the market, Apple s business would be crushed if a better product was introduced by a competitor.

Earnings would decrease substantially and Apple might not be able to afford its interest payments. These concerns absolutely impact the company s credit rating   and a lack of diversification is one of the key differences between Apple and the AAA-rated Johnson & Johnson and Microsoft.

Investors are very aware of the importance of iPhone sales to Apple s business model. This was evident when the company reported first-quarter financial results.

Because of better-than-expected iPhone sales, Apple s stock surged 6%.

It takes a huge amount of buyers in the market to move the needle by 6% on a company as large as Apple ($700 billion+ market capitalization). Clearly, investors were pleased with the profits generated from Apple s iPhone segment.

Geographically, Apple s business is much more diversified.

Source: Apple First Quarter Earnings Presentation

In the company s most recent quarter, ~$32 billion (or 41%) of Apple s revenues were generated from it s largest geographic segment, while ~$54 billion (or 69%) of the company s revenues were generated from the iPhone.

It is highly likely that the rating agencies (along with the company s investors) are concerned about the amount of concentration that Apple has on the iPhone. Luckily, more operational diversification is on the way.

This will be driven by one primary factor, in my view   the growth of Apple Services.

This segment currently composes only 9% of Apple s revenues but has been growing rapidly. Apple s Services segment is already the size of a Fortune 100 company.

Looking ahead, Services revenue is expected to grow to double in the next four years   which represents a CAGR of ~19%. This will bring up Apple s overall efficiency, as the Services segment has higher margins than the rest of Apple s businesses.

Additionally, Macquarie research analysts have recently published a note saying they believe Apple Services to be undervalued. If the segment was valued similarly to PayPal, Macquarie estimates that the stock would be 10% higher after a sum-of-parts analysis.

To conclude, Apple s earnings mix is heavily reliant on the iPhone. When the company becomes more diversified, largely driven by Services, Apple s credit outlook will improve significantly.

Final Thoughts

Apple is a high-quality business with many of the low-risk characteristics of a creditworthy company.

With  the mother of all balance sheets  the only thing holding Apple back from the coveted AAA credit rating is a lack of operational diversification. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) And Others File ... Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have filed a legal notice in support of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is protesting a government order to give out emails stored on foreign servers.

The amicus brief follows a decision by a judge in early February to rule in favor of FBI in the case. The FBI issued Google which is based in Mountain View with a warrant demanding information regarding three Gmail accounts stored overseas.

In an amicus brief, the four tech companies who are major competitors with Google in a number of ways, they are supporting the rights of tech companies to hold foreign data from domestic law enforcement agencies. The companies argue that if the court approves the warrant, it will prompt foreign law enforcement agencies to demand access to information held on American servers.

Microsoft in January won a case of the same kind against the investigative agency which had served it with a search warrant to access emails from a non-U.S. Citizen that were being held in the company s servers in Ireland.

In yet a similar case, the top tech companies have ganged in support of Apple in a case where in the company is protesting a judge order to unlock an iPhone belonging to a dead terrorist.

A total of fifteen companies including Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) under the friend-of-the-court status seek to overturn an order compelling Apple to set up a special software to be used by the FBI in unlocking an iPhone that belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook who died in a shootout with law enforcement after he killed 14 people at a San Bernardino-based holiday party in California.

While confirming their commitment to cooperating with law enforcement agencies to wipe out criminals they oppose the assertion by the government that they have the legal approval to demand a command a company to undermine their security features.

Twitter Inc (NYSE:TWTR), eBay Inc (NASDAQ:EBAY) and a group of other 17 companies requested to separately support Apple in the fight. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) both requested to join the case on support of Apple. They argue that the court ruling will kill innovation and finally decrease security.

There's an epic battle brewing for the title of Best Smartphone of 2017. The favorite at this point is Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 10th-anniversary iPhone 8, due out in September. It's going up against the Galaxy S8 from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (OTCMKTS:SSNLF), the company's first big release since the botched Galaxy Note 7.

But Samsung can't seem to keep its forthcoming flagship under wraps. The latest Galaxy S8 leak reveals the new smartphone in all three launch colors, plus its pricing.

Galaxy S8 Leak Shows Colors, Price

After the last Galaxy S8 leak from Sunday, we now know the available colors of Samsung's next smartphone, as well as the launch price. Evan Blass took to his Twitter account to post images of the Galaxy S8 in Black Sky, Orchid Gray and Arctic Silver.

And how much will consumers have to shell out for the hot new phone? Blass says the Galaxy S8 will start at 799 , while the larger Galaxy S8+ will retail for 899  and up. In U.S. dollars, that's approximately $859 and $1075, respectively.

The new DeX docking station for the smartphones will reportedly go for 150 , or about $161.

Samsung Even Leaked Its Own Smartphone Details

Samsung has had a tough time keeping the lid on its newest flagship smartphone. In fact, at this point there's not much we don't know about it. But, this isn't because of shadowy supply chain sources like the ones AAPL has had to deal with while trying to keep the iPhone 8 under wraps. Rather, more than a few Galaxy S8 leaks have included actual detailed photographs of the smartphone and its key features, videos, slip-ups from carriers who will be selling the phone, and even Samsung itself.

It was Samsung that accidentally posted on its own website that the new AI assistant on the Galaxy S8 will be named Bixby, and that Bixby will integrate with a new Samsung Pay Mini service.

Other key Galaxy S8 leak details to date include:

Does the Latest Galaxy S8 Leak Help AAPL?

The more AAPL knows in advance about what will be its primary competition in the battle for best smartphone this year, the better. The latest Galaxy S8 leak provides some seemingly useful information, in particular the price.

There's been a lot of complaining about the suggestion that AAPL might launch the new iPhone 8 at a starting price of $1,000 or more - a huge jump over the usual $649 base for an iPhone. If Samsung charges in excess of $1,000 for the Galaxy S8+, that will take some pressure off Apple.

An $859 Galaxy S8 may be even better news. If AAPL keeps its traditional pricing model for the iPhone 7s - its "regular" smartphone release for 2017 - a new Apple iPhone would slide in with a $200 price advantage over the Samsung competition.

Apple also could choose to mess with Samsung's release timing. With the Galaxy S8 launch on Mar. 29 and release on Apr. 21, Apple could hold its own big product event in that same time frame (something it's actually expected to do). Doing so would surely take some of the spotlight off the Galaxy S8 during what's sure to be a critical launch window.

Of course, the more information AAPL has about its competitor early on, the more time management has to fine-tune the iPhone 8 prior to release. Galaxy S8 leaks already show a near-bezel-free smartphone with Iris scanning, wireless charging, no physical Home button, a very powerful CPU and an all-new AI-powered personal assistant.

In other words, the iPhone 7s is going to face competition that outclasses it in many respects, while many of the expected iPhone 8 features are already going to be available from the competition. Perhaps it's time for AAPL designers and engineers to double down on the iPhone 8 finishing touches.

As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. Apple Is A Top 5 Holding It took awhile, but Apple found its way into my retirement income portfolio.

Apple - One product, then the eco system, then the stock

In 2008, I went to an AT&T (NYSE:T) store to replace my old cell phone with a Blackberry. Several of my friends had one and I thought the little keyboard was cool. I walked into the store and told a very young clerk that I wanted a Blackberry. He pointed me to the Blackberry display and said, "Before you make a final decision, can I show you my phone?" I said, "Sure." He pulled out his Apple iPhone. (This was just after the first generation iPhone began to offer 16GB of memory rather than 8GB. He showed me the new touch screen. It may have taken me 30 seconds to make a decision, but I believe it was closer to 15. Nine years, and several generations, later, I still use an iPhone. Since 2010, our family has used the Apple operating system exclusively.

It took awhile, but Apple found its way into the portfolio

I wasn't so quick to buy the stock, however. The main problem was the absence of a dividend. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) paid a small dividend from 1988 to 1995, and re-instituted a dividend in August, 2012. I began to study Apple and realized that it was relatively cheap on a price/earnings basis, but I wanted a lower entry point. In mid-2013, when AAPL dropped to $58 (split adjusted) I made an initial purchase, hoping to get more around $53. I missed a chance to get a full position at $55.70. (That was my first mistake.) The stock started moving up and, disappointed, I sold my small stake rather than completing the position around $60. (That was my second mistake.)

In mid-2016, I began to warm up to AAPL again. I was moving the portfolio toward higher credit ratings, and Apple's Standard & Poor's credit rating of AA+ is stellar. By September, I identified a target price of $92. It bounced around in the low $100s, and I bought a full position at $104.78. My usual pattern is to build a position gradually, but the first time I tried that with Apple in 2013, I was disappointed. This time, I decided to jump into the deep end of the pool - sink or swim. Immediately, it was my fifth largest holding. Today, without adding any additional shares, AAPL is my fourth largest holding.

Growth of Apple

Here's a snapshot of Apple's growth since 2008. Sales, Pre-Tax Profit, and Net Income are in billions.

The rise and fall and rise again of Apple is now part of stock market lore. This story was captured in the 1994 movie, Forrest Gump, which includes this line from Forrest about Dan, his former Army officer and former partner in the shrimp business:

I never went back to work for Lieutenant Dan. Though he did take care of my Bubba-Gump money. He got me invested in some kind of fruit company. And so then I got a call from him saying we don't have to worry about money no more and I said, "That's good. One less thing."

Why I'm Long Apple

Unlike Forrest Gump, I was not an "early adopter" Apple investor. I used an IBM personal computer at work and at home I used a PC that was built by an IT friend. I was aware that Macs were preferred by artists and designers, but I never considered buying an Apple computer or making an investment in Apple. As I described at the beginning of the article, that changed when I bought an iPhone in 2008, followed by Mac computers.

Apple has a history of marketing excellence

I'm not a Peter Lynch, investigative style researcher. I don't walk around malls observing which stores are empty and which are full. But when our family embraced the Apple eco system, it meant occasional visits to Apple retail stores. Two were in strip malls and one was in an enclosed mall. In each case, the Apple store by far had the most-traffic of any other store in sight. The quality of the product and the retail experience made up for high prices. My good experience as an Apple customer put the company in a positive light and when Apple initiated a dividend, I began to study the stock.

Apple developed a culture, originally centered around Steve Jobs, that didn't seek to provide what the customer wanted, but sought to shape what the customer needed. The company anticipated, then drove, customer demand.

My son was originally drawn to Apple because of its early, colorful computers (some of which had transparent cases), but he has never left PCs and after using an iPhone for several years, he opted for a Samsung phone. His primary reason was his preference for an open operating system rather than Apple's closed, proprietary system. In contrast to his decision, many Apple customers are comfortable with Apple's closed operating system.

Apple supplemented its company retail stores with telecom partnerships that made it easy for mobile phone customers to choose an iPhone, with payments embedded in their telecom contracts spread over two years. The telecom "subsidies" have been modified so that more iPhone users purchase the phone directly, though still often spread over numerous payments.

One reason I'm long Apple is I've been impressed with its retail operation.

Apple has been a disruptive industry leader

Apple was a pioneer in the computer industry. Apple's iPod transformed the music industry. The iPhone disrupted the mobile, "smart phone" industry. The jury is still out on the competition between the Apple Watch and Fitbit.

Apple TV is now in its fourth generation and appears to be the basis for future generations of a multi-purpose appliance that provides access to various ways of presenting video programming.

There has been much speculation about an Apple Car. Some analysts have encouraged Apple to focus on the "dashboard" technology that could be used by multiple vehicle manufacturers rather than becoming a "car company." In January, 2017, MacRumors produced "Apple Car." On February 17, 2017, Digital Trends published an "Apple Car Rumor Roundup." On March 8, 2017, 9to5Mac published "Apple Car: Everything We Know About Apple's Rumored Electric Car."

Apple's success with the iPod and the iPhone, coupled with Apple's deep pockets, continue to intrigue investors, though many naysayers abound, having become impatient about the "next big thing."

The question remains: What will be Apple's next attempt at disrupting an industry? I have no insight about what its next initiative might be, but its capacity to continue to be a disrupter is one reason I'm long Apple.

Apple is committed to a dividend

Apple's dividend history is relatively short. And, while Apple has shown a stronger commitment to share buybacks, it has indicated that a dividend will continue to be part of its future.

Some companies are clear and transparent about their dividend policy. I would welcome a clear dividend policy (i.e., a percentage range of earnings per share), but Apple plays the dividend card close to its vest. One reason I'm long Apple is its financial capacity to pay a significant and steadily growing dividend.

I'm long Apple because it has a stellar, AA+ credit rating from Standard & Poor's.

Apple is a major presence in a dominant industry

Technology is 21.74% of the US equity market, by far the largest sector. Apple continues to show impressive long-term growth, even though FY 2016 was Apple's first year to show an earnings decline. Technology will continue to be a major factor in moving the economy and society. Apple is poised to continue to be a major presence in this industry.

F.A.S.T. Graphs

(Graph from F.A.S.T. Graphs)

I don't recall seeing a F.A.S.T. Graph where the stock price (black line) is so far below the "normal P/E" (blue line).

For about 18 months in the recent past, Apple's market price was well below the "fair value" line represented by a 15 P/E, but it has now moved slightly above the fair value line.

Apple has a relatively low 33% debt-to-capitalization level. The graph indicates that Apple's stock price is sitting near its all-time high.

Better Investing

(Company research from Better Investing)

The 5-year data provided by Better Investing indicates that Apple's high yield was 3.0% at one point during 2013. The current yield is a relatively low 1.6%. Apple is expected to announce a dividend increase this month.

The current P/E of 16.7 is well above the 5-year average P/E of 12.8.

Simply Safe Dividends

Simply Safe Dividends provides a helpful snapshot of Apple's safety, growth and yield, showing that for safety and growth, Apple is above the 90th percentile of corporations, but with a relatively low yield.

Tim Cook

Apple's current Chief Executive Officer is Tim Cook, who joined Apple in 1998 and succeeded Steve Jobs as CEO after Jobs' death in 2011. Prior to serving as CEO, Cook was Apple's Chief Operating Officer. Earlier, he had a 12-year career at IBM, then he served as COO at Intelligent Electronics and finally (for six months) at Compaq as Vice President of Corporate Materials, procuring and managing product inventory. As COO of Apple, Cook was recognized as the skilled manager of Apple's global supply chain.

The Future

Apple will soon move its headquarters to a 175-acre "Second Campus," which was named Apple Park in Cupertino, California. The company said it will take over six months to move 12,000 employees into the new site and that some construction will continue during the summer.

The new headquarters is a statement of Apple's confidence in its future growth. It's an open question whether Apple will be able to maintain its leadership position in technology. Some skeptics see it as a "one trick pony," with the iPhone generating about 60% of Apple's 2016 sales. Will it go the way of IBM, which has managed to provide dividend growth in the midst of steadily declining sales? Or, will it find new energy, as Microsoft seems to be doing?

(Photo of Apple's Second Campus from MacWorld)

Tim Cook begins his seventh year as Apple's CEO. He is emerging as a significant leader in his own right, even though he is yet to be identified with a "next big thing." He has been a solid leader, even if he hasn't infused the company with new energy, as Microsoft's Satya Nadella has done. The creative legacy and marketing savvy of Steve Jobs will be forever in the background of Apple, even as Cook and future company leaders seek to continue Apple's innovations and industry disruptions.

How Intel Corporation Can Strengthen Its Relationship With Apple Inc. With the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) scored a lucky break, winning a significant portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's latest handsets -- arguably the highest-profile smartphone win Intel has ever enjoyed.

Intel cellular modem chips, branded the XMM 7360, are found inside versions of the iPhone 7 devices used on networks that don't implement the CDMA cellular standard. Chips from rival Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) are found in the iPhone models used on CDMA networks, as Intel's chips currently don't implement CDMA.

Back in late 2015, Intel purchased the CDMA chipset assets from a company called VIA Telecom, presumably in a bid to allow the former to build chips that could address the entirety of Apple's cellular modem needs.

Though Qualcomm is widely believed to build superior modems to what Intel produces, Apple recently filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm alleging, among other things, in the complain filed on Jan. 20 that:

Qualcomm has charged Apple a monopolistic premium for access to CDMA chipsets that are in all other aspects identical to chipsets sold to Apple without CDMA functionality enabled. ... Qualcomm has used its monopoly power in CDMA chipsets to obtain anticompetitive license and chipset supply terms.

I'll be writing more on the lawsuit in the coming days and today there is an observation I would like to share regarding Apple, Intel, Qualcomm, and CDMA iPhones.

Apple's component costs could come down if Intel succeeds in implementing CDMA

Based on this complaint, we now know that Qualcomm charges Apple more for the same exact cellular modems with CDMA enabled compared to versions without CDMA enabled. This isn't an unusual practice in the semiconductor industry; companies like Intel routinely charge more for identical chips but with certain features enabled, compared with variants without those features enabled. This is plain old product segmentation at work.

What's interesting is that Apple is complaining that, because Qualcomm essentially has no viable competition for its CDMA-enabled modems, it is charging a "monopolistic premium."

The magnitude of this premium isn't clear, but it's clear that Apple isn't happy about having to pay it, and therein lies the opportunity for Intel.

If Intel can develop a commercially viable LTE modem that also supports CDMA (and is certified on all of the major CDMA networks) using those VIA Telecom assets, then this would open the door to a couple of possibilities:

Intel could win more than just the non-CDMA iPhones. It could be a true "second source" for all the iPhones that Apple ships. This could potentially boost Intel's share at Apple, to Intel's benefit (and to Qualcomm's detriment). Apple could be able to get cheaper CDMA modems from Qualcomm. Even if Apple doesn't increase the proportion of total modems that it purchases from Intel, the fact that Intel and Qualcomm parts would be viable for all iPhone models could help reduce the average price that Apple pays per cellular modem.

Net-net, Intel's becoming a stronger cellular modem provider would mean that Apple should, in general, pay less for modems. This could help modestly improve Apple's gross profit margin and, ultimately, net profit.

To put this into perspective, in the complaint, Apple says that LTE modems sell for between $10 and $20. Let's suppose that Apple must pay $15 for the non-CDMA Qualcomm chips and then $20 for the CDMA-capable Qualcomm chips -- though with the iPhone 7, Apple doesn't appear to be buying any non-CDMA Qualcomm chips; the non-CDMA iPhones now use Intel.

If Apple can get that $20 figure down to $15 in the presence of a viable alternative from Intel, then that's $5 saved across potentially 100 million or more iPhone models sold in a year. That $5 figure is for illustrative purposes only, as I have no clue what the actual delta is, but multiplied across the volumes that Apple sells, the savings Apple could potentially realize are significant.

Intel needs to execute

The key to all of this is for Intel to execute to building increasingly competitive cellular modems. If Intel can, then that's obviously a positive for Intel, as an opportunity to sell more modems, and an opportunity for Apple, in the form of cheaper modems.

The loser, if Intel can supply more of Apple's volume -- whether or not it actually does -- would be Qualcomm, as at the very least it could see the premium that it enjoys from the sale of CDMA-capable LTE modems evaporate.

In the scheme of things, though, losing a bit more Apple chip business probably isn't going to sting Qualcomm that much. After all, Intel grabbed a bunch of iPhone share this cycle, yet Qualcomm's chip business appears to be on the right track. 
2017-02-23
A Slight Negative for This Apple Inc. Supplier Emerges Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg. Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) is the world's largest contract chip manufacturer. It manufactures chips for some of the largest, most powerful companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as well as for small chip companies you might not have ever heard of.

TSMC is in the unique situation of having a very strong position inside of Apple's iPhone line of smartphones -- it is believed to be the exclusive manufacturer of Apple's custom-designed A10 processor and it is also believed to be the manufacturer of the Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X12 and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) XMM 7360 cellular modems found inside of each iPhone sold today.

Going forward, it looks as though TSMC is set to see revenues from iPhone cellular modems vanish.

Gone either this cycle, or next

If Apple chooses to reuse the Snapdragon X12 modem as well as adopt Intel's XMM 7480 cellular modem for the upcoming iPhone product cycle, then TSMC should enjoy another year of cellular modem revenues (since the XMM 7480 is also believed to be manufactured at TSMC).

However, after that it is likely that Apple will adopt the Intel XMM 7560 cellular modem as well as either the Qualcomm Snapdragon X16 or Snapdragon X20 modem (if it doesn't ultimately adopt one of them this cycle).

The Snapdragon X16 is manufactured by Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) on its 14-nanometer LPP technology and the Snapdragon X20 is manufactured by Samsung using its 10-nanometer LPE technology.

The Intel XMM 7560 is, unlike previous Intel modems, manufactured by Intel itself using some variant of its 14-nanometer manufacturing technology.

So, at some point within the next iPhone cycle or two, Apple is likely going to be sourcing modems from both Qualcomm and Intel that aren't manufactured by TSMC.

What does this mean for TSMC's business?

If we assume that this business is worth something on the order of $1 billion in annual revenue (200 million units multiplied by a rough estimate of $5 per unit), then -- all else equal -- TSMC stands to see a roughly 3% revenue decline from the eventual loss of this business (based on current analyst consensus which calls for TSMC to rake in about $32.22 billion in revenue this year).

That's certainly less than ideal, but such a loss isn't going to dramatically impact the company's financial position. After all, the company still benefits from the growth of the overall smartphone market (as it is a critical supplier of many key smartphone processor makers) and I wouldn't be surprised to see silicon content within smartphones continue to grow in the years ahead as smartphones continue to integrate more features and functionality.

In other words, TSMC should be able to more than make up the potential declines elsewhere within the mobile market.

What about for Intel's and Samsung's?

Samsung's contract chip manufacturing business used to rely on the manufacture of Apple's A-series applications processors, but it seems to have lost that business to TSMC for the foreseeable future. Getting some logic silicon content in the iPhone again via the manufacture of Qualcomm's modems certainly can't hurt.

A similar argument applies to Intel. The company is looking to expand its total addressable market partly to grow revenue and partly to continue to have enough chip scale to keep its expensive factories filled with chips. By manufacturing and shipping tens of millions, if not more than 100 million cellular baseband chips (eventually) annually, the company has quite a lot of "guaranteed" volume for its factories year-in and year-out.

In other words, I'd say that TSMC losing business to Intel and Samsung is probably more of a positive for the latter two's businesses than it is a negative for TSMC. 2 Choices For Apple Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is at a crossroads where they have to make a decision to rely on the slowing growth of the iPhone or shift their focus to their services segment. Below are two models comparing the effects of both options. For comparison, the base case DCF model, with no shift in revenue distributions or expenditure growth, values AAPL shares at $130.29.

Though the first route seems grim, because of slowing smartphone growth as shown in the chart from Statista below, let's take a look at the numbers.

In the past two years, Apple has increased its R&D by an average 19.07%. By projecting this rate forward and normalizing with a percent of sales figure the model expects R&D to be 6.53% of sales in 2019. To benefit the iPhone and maintain current rates of growth for other lines R&D will have to increase at a higher rate, and the extra spending must be devoted solely to the new iPhone's development.

To model this the rate of increase is bumped up to 25%. The extra 5.93% puts R&D spending at 7.43% of sales. This will also be boosted by a larger expected sales number overall. With Apple's record of reliable innovation that customers believe in an increase in R&D would likely result in positive growth. Prior to the drop this year the iPhone sales were increasing at 35.6% year over year. To restore the sales growth rate quarter over quarter sales must increase by a net 2.8% quarter over quarter in 2017 and then increase at a 1% rate moving forward. Also, since the iPad can benefit from new technologies implemented in the iPhone the model also adds .7% quarter over quarter net increase in 2017 sales for the iPad. The increase is severely dampened due to the iPhone 6, and 7 Plus offering iPad-like screens, and these large-format phones are cannibalizing iPad sales. Case in point, the revenue for the Microsoft Surface line doubled in 2016 to its highest level to date, while revenues for the iPad have been slowing down since Q1 2014 as shown below.

But in ideal conditions some new customers, from other smartphone lines, will likely adopt the Apple ecosystem through an iPad. With these changes the new model values the firm at $147.16.

The second scenario comes from wording in the last quarterly report. Apple says "as part of its strategy, (Apple) continues to expand its platform for the discovery, and delivery of digital content, and applications through its Digital Content, and Services, which allows customers to discover, and download digital content." As premium hardware lines from several tech companies have saturated the market, Apple is leveraging a customer that is encapsulated in Apple gear by offering them services to complement their hardware. To do so they will have to increase R&D again, but this time devote it primarily to developing the Services unit. It is also important to note that in this scenario they cannot shy away from continuing innovation in the hardware lines. Failing to sustain the current hardware ecosystem will cause customers to move over to more lucrative, and innovative lines. For this reason, R&D will have to be significantly increased.

Again, time for the numbers. As mentioned R&D will have to be significantly increased. For this scenario, the increase is 30% over the three-year average putting the 2019 figure at 8.36% of sales. The stark bump in expense here is due to new development. Building new services from the ground up takes more capital especially when the customer base expects the utmost quality. As with all stocks, this is a gamble. A product failure would put Apple several years back in cash flow, thus forcing them into a corner for future options. As with high risk, however, there is a possibility of high reward. Assuming an industry average scenario this tremendous increase in expected expenses is also offset by a large growth rate.

Subscription-based service companies such as Netflix and Spotify have experienced 20.71% and 81.76% annual revenue growth in the past five years, respectively. Taking an average of both firms we arrive to a value of 51.23%. Though these firms had the first mover advantage, Apple has the ability to push convenience and integration through current Apple product users. Moreover, Apple represents a strong but growable position as shown below in MIDI's research.

Clearly users appreciate the product as it has a sizable market share. A net increase of 5.5% in 2017 and 5% growth from then on puts the revenue stream just shy of 50%. The model also accounts for an increase in iPhone and iPad sales by 5% from 2018 on. Assuming the services are successful and able to reach the expected growth rate, more users will move into the Apple ecosystem than expected, thus driving up hardware sales. Using these inputs the firm is valued at $149.21.

These valuations are very close showing the increase in reinvestment creates a similar trajectory whatever choice Apple takes. It is safe to assume with the current effectiveness of the firm's capital the stock should appreciate regardless of the option or even with a blend of both.

The coming quarter and shift toward or away from hardware will show which option they are taking. This said, the second growth factor is much more likely. With heavy smartphone saturation, it would be a feat for the iPhone to regain lost ground in growth rates. As shown above smartphones sales are expected to consistently fall from 2018 on.

The only viable option to break this trend is to increase the rate at which current Apple customers switch to the next iPhone. Currently iPhone users are 20% more likely to switch to the new model when released, according to Forbes. With such a large lead, it is unlikely the firm will push this gain further.

Unless Apple is able to convey to customers to buy several phones, switch to the new model more often, or increase the access of their hardware to new markets it is terribly unlikely they will break the trend. For this reason, it is much more likely the firm will opt for the second choice. Going the services route should improve margins, diversify revenue streams, and result in higher free cash flow. But this model is highly dependent on Apple's ability to deliver. A large investiture in R&D is at the end of the day a gamble. As an investor, you have to decide whether Apple is a pair of aces or a two and a three. Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Camera Will Be Revolutionary As we get closer to September and the expected launch of the 10th anniversary iPhone, there have been rumors that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) could charge $1,000 or more for the device.

Source: Apple

One reason for the unprecedented starting price may now have been revealed. A veteran Apple analyst reports the new iPhone 8 will feature a revolutionary new 3D FaceTime camera. This will allow Apple to incorporate high-tech features like facial recognition, and could be the missing piece that lets the company push into augmented reality.

9to5 Mac published details of a report, released yesterday by KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. According to Kuo, iPhone 8 won t push the limits of the primary camera the way the dual-lens system on the iPhone 7 Plus did. Instead, it will get a new FaceTime camera he describes a  revolutionary. 

The KGI report says the new camera will incorporate an advanced infrared sensor, and employ technology developed by PrimeSense   the Israeli 3D sensor company Apple bought in 2013. Together, the camera lens, IR transmitter and IR receiver will be able to accurately track the depth and location of objects. In other words, an advanced 3D sensing system.

KGI even has the component manufacturers identified. Ming-Chi Kuo says Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) will produce the FaceTime camera module. Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd (OTCMKTS:HNHPF)   Foxconn to you and me   is expected to make the IR sensors. Lumentum Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LITE) will provide laser technology. Algorithms from PrimeSense will make sense of all the imaging data, along with facial recognition know-how from the 2015 Apple purchase Metaio.

IPhone 8 FaceTime Camera: The Key to Facial Recognition and AR

The FaceTime camera is the iPhone s so-called  selfie  camera. So what s the point of packing this camera with advanced technology? Better selfies?

By going this route, the iPhone 8 gains a number of significant features that have previously been hinted at. The system could be used for 3D facial recognition and/or iris scanning. This advanced biometric capability would be more secure than the current Touch ID fingerprint system and could help AAPL to drive Apple Pay adoption. Facial recognition would also be a hig- tech selling feature.

The technology would also support Apple s augmented reality ambitions. We ve previously written about how Apple CEO Tim Cook has been increasingly vocal about AR and its potential to be a game-changing technology. That promotion has stepped up in the past year, leading to speculation AAPL is preparing to release a product with augmented reality as a key feature.

WEEKLY LONG CALLS IN APPLE INC

Trading long calls in Apple using weekly options for the last three-years has been a winner. But, there was a way to substantially increase returns while literally cutting risk in half   a 50% reduction in risk. Here s how we do it.

First, we run a three-year back-test of buying the 50 delta (at the money) call option in Apple Inc every week (weekly options). These are the results:

We can see a 219% return, and even though the trades were only winners 40% of the time, the wins were well worth the losses. But that should trigger a thought:

What if we could limit the downside and test it systematically?

It turns out that we can do exactly that. Here is the same weekly long call test in Apple Inc but this time we put a stop loss at 50%. In English, if the long call loses 50% of its value, we sell it, close the position, and trade the week after. Here is how that strategy looked:

All of a sudden we see that 219% return spike up to 242%. But here s the real gem   this test has cut the risk in half. While the original test could have seen a long call lose all of its value (100%) in a given week, now we have limited that loss to 50%. Yes, we see greater returns for less risk.

But this approach goes well further than a three-year time period with Apple Inc. Let s now do this weekly option trade for the last two-years, and to make the results easier to read, we will put them side-by-side. The left side is the normal weekly call option, the right hand side is the one with a 50% stop loss.

Read More Apple Speaks Out Against President Trump's Actions (Again) Apple has publicly spoken out against the Trump administration's withdrawal of some Obama-era transgender protections in a statement it sent to Axios on Wednesday.

The directive given by former President Barack Obama last year granted transgender students the choice to use public school restrooms and locker rooms matching their gender identity.

Without the directive, states and school districts will now have to decide whether to grant those protections to transgender students.

Apple's statement read:

"Apple believes everyone deserves a chance to thrive in an environment free from stigma and discrimination. We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals. We disagree with any effort to limit or rescind their rights and protections."

It's not the first time Apple has spoken out against the Trump administration's policies. In an email sent to Apple's employees, Apple CEO Tim Cook said Trump's executive action on immigration "is not a policy we support."

Battle of Dividends: Apple, Inc. vs Microsoft Even tech stocks can sometimes be solid dividend stocks for income investors. And two of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector are undoubtedly Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). But which of these two dividend-paying tech juggernauts is the better bet for investors looking for income?

Comparing these two dividend stocks is particularly timely, given that Apple stock has soared about 21% in the past three months while Microsoft has lagged with a 2.4% gain during the same period. After Apple's recent rise in its stock price, is Microsoft looking more attractive?

Microsoft

Company Dividend Yield Payout Ratio 3-Year Compound Average Dividend Growth Rate EPS Growth in Most Recent Quarter Microsoft 2.4% 69.5% 11.7% 6.6%

Microsoft is a well-rounded dividend stock. With a dividend yield of 2.4%, the software giant easily beats Apple's 1.6% dividend yield. Going further, the yield is meaningfully higher than the 2% average dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500.

However, to achieve this dividend yield, Microsoft needs to pay out a higher portion of its earnings than Apple does. In the trailing 12 months, Microsoft has paid out 69.5% of its earnings in dividends. Notably, however, Microsoft's dividend payments as a percentage of its free cash flow are just 42%. Paying out only 42% of its annual free cash flow in dividends, Microsoft's dividend is easily sustainable.

Another area where Microsoft shines as a dividend stock is in the company's underlying earnings growth. Microsoft has recently witnessed a strong return to earnings growth, with EPS up 6.6% in the company's most recent quarter. This earnings growth should help Microsoft maintain its 11.7% average annual dividend increase of the past three years.

Apple

Company Dividend Yield Payout Ratio 3-Year Compound Average Dividend Growth Rate EPS Growth in Most Recent Quarter Apple 1.6% 27% 9% 2.3%

Apple's weaknesses as a dividend stock compared with Microsoft are immediately apparent. Its 1.6% dividend yield is well below Microsoft's and even below the average 2% dividend yield of stocks in the S&P 500. Further, Apple's earnings growth recently is paltry. In the company's most recent quarter, EPS rose just 2.3% year over year.

But Apple stands out when it comes to its payout ratio. With a payout ratio of just 27%, Apple has substantial room for further dividend increases in the future. And Apple's dividend payments as a percentage of its free cash flow are even lower, at just 23%.

So while Apple's three-year average annualized dividend growth of 9% is lower than Microsoft's 11.7% average annualized growth during the same period, Apple's dividend looks as if it will probably grow faster in the coming years.

Overall, it seems that Apple's rising stock price recently has suppressed the company's dividend yield to a low enough level to make Microsoft look like the better dividend stock today -- a different conclusion from in my November 2015 comparison, when Apple's dividend yield was higher and its payout ratio was even lower. However, while Microsoft may be the better dividend stock today, Apple still looks like an attractive bet for income investors thanks to the growth potential evident from the company's very low payout ratio. What Will Apple Inc. (AAPL) Show Off in Its April Event? There are three announcements we ve been waiting for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) to make in the near future:

A March special event to launch an upgraded 12.9-inch iPad Pro and 9.7-inch iPad Air replacement.

A third iPad  an all new 10.5-inch iPad Pro with design cues from the iPhone 8  seems ready to go in May or June.

The move-in date for its new Apple Park  spaceship  campus.

A new report suggests the company is juggling the timelines and plans to hold an April Apple Event combining all three.

New iPads Are Overdue

Apple s iPad lineup may not be doing the same business it once was, but it s still due for a refresh.

The iPad Pro line aimed at prosumers is priced at a premium, helping to boost revenue for the division, but it competes against some tough adversaries, including Microsoft Corporation s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface Pro. Apple is expected to release a next generation version of 2015 s 12.9-inch iPad Pro to stay current.

An all-new iPad Pro that is also expected in the late spring. This one is a 10.5-inch form factor, but it seems likely to borrow from the design of the upcoming iPhone 8, with an edge-to-edge display and virtual Home button. Doing so gives AAPL a physically smaller iPad Pro, with a display larger than the current 9.7-inch iPad Pro, making it more useful for professionals.

The company is expected to also ship a replacement for the iPad Air 2, its full-sized consumer tablet that was released in 2014.

The new iPad Air and 12.9-inch iPad Pro were expected to be unveiled in March, but with the month half-over, an April Apple event seems more likely.

Such a move also jives with rumors back in January that AAPL might be experiencing some manufacturing challenges that could result in a later release.

New iPads Identified in the Wild

On Monday, 9to5 Mac broke the news that an analytics firm has detected the identifiers for new iPad models in app downloads in the Cupertino area. The model numbers show up as iPad 7,1; iPad 7,2; iPad 7,3 and iPad 7,4   current iPad models show up in logs as iPad 6,x. 9to5 Mac notes that four new identifiers don t necessarily mean four new models, as an iPad equipped with LTE has different numbers than the same version in a Wi-Fi-only option.

The new models first showed up last September, but the frequency accelerated rapidly in January and February, indicating the new iPads are getting close to being launch-ready.

Apple Park Ready for Its Grand Opening

Apple Park is AAPL s massive new headquarters, nicknamed the  spaceship campus  because of its round, futuristic design.

Next Page Apple Inc. Has A Secret iPhone Calibration Machine Apple undoubtedly places customer satisfaction and innovation as top priorities, and the fact that it offers great repairs takes customer satisfaction to a whole new level. The company has been very secretive about the machines it uses for the repairs, but a recent image leak just revealed some details on these unsung Apple heroes.

How the calibration machine helps Apple in repairs

Apple s repair system has been in the news since for some time, thanks to Jason Koebler of Motherboard. The latest update from Koebler is an image of Apple s secret repair machine that replaces damaged Touch ID sensors on iPhones. According to Koebler, before handing over the device to the owner, Apple makes sure that it has been calibrated to factory standards using the iPhone calibration machine.

A former Genius worker told Motherboard,  It was a big clunky machine that honestly looked like someone built it in their backyard. There were different  moulds  that different iPhone models would go into before going in the machine, and it would take around 30 minutes.  there was some weird liquid that needed to be placed in the machine that we would have to wear gloves with to fix it. 

Such repair machines from Apple offer the utmost security safeguards to owners and ensure consistent repair experiences among users and stores. However, such experiences are being threatened because of the so-called  right to repair  bill. If the bill is passed, it could force the iPhone maker to make public its manuals, parts and specialized iPhone machines.

Could help third-party repair shops

This machine not only allows technicians to change screens and calibrate the devices, but it also allows replacement of the Touch ID home button. Also a newly-installed fingerprint sensor on a device can be validated using the repair machine. To do this, it has to be connected to a Mac, notes AppleInsider.

A number of iPhones were rendered unusable in 2015 because of the  Error 53  code after owners got them repaired by third parties. This code is an iOS security message, and is displayed on the devices that have been through unauthorized Touch ID repairs. So this new image could be a big help for third-party repair stores which seek to lure iPhone owners by offering repairs at lower prices but haven t been able to offer similar repairs, notes BGR.

Don't Overlook This Underappreciated Apple, Inc. Business Segment When Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reports its results for its first fiscal quarter of 2017 on Jan. 31, many investors will likely turn immediately to iPhone sales. After all, the important product accounts for a whopping 60% of its revenue. Investors, however, shouldn't overlook Apple's services segment. As the tech giant's second-largest and fastest-growing product segment, it is crucial to its business.

A bright spot amid growth challenges

In Apple's fourth fiscal quarter of 2016, the services segment stood out as an exception to the rest of the company's product segments' flat or declining sales. Its services revenue, which includes revenue from the App Store, iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, licensing, and other services, increased an impressive 24% year over year. Meanwhile, revenue for the iPhone, Mac, and other product segments declined, and iPad revenue was flat year over year.

CEO Tim Cook was particularly pleased with the company's record-setting services revenue during the quarter. "App Store revenue continued to skyrocket, while Music revenue grew by 22% thanks to the growing popularity of Apple Music," he said. He also noted that Apple is seeing "very strong growth in transaction volume through Apple Pay."

Going forward, Cook explained the high expectations for the segment:

We remain very confident about the future of our Services business given the unmatched level of engagement, satisfaction and loyalty of our growing installed base. We have almost doubled the size of our services revenue in the last 4 years, and as we've said before, we expect it to be the size of a Fortune 100 company in fiscal 2017.

What would it look like for its services segment to be the size of a Fortune 100 company? Currently, the company with the lowest revenue on Fortune's top 100 list of companies has annual revenue of $28 billion -- about $4 billion more than Apple's services revenue in fiscal 2016. So, Apple believes its fiscal 2017 services revenue will exceed $28 billion.

Impressively, beyond being Apple's only segment that grew in the fiscal fourth quarter, the segment also posted a meaningfully higher growth rate than it did in the quarter before it. Fourth-quarter services revenue increased 24% year over year. This is up from 19% growth in Q3 and 20% growth in Q2.

What to expect from services in Q1

For the first fiscal quarter of 2017, it's likely Apple can at least maintain its current 24% year-over-year growth in services revenue. CFO Luca Maestri said the company's App Store growth rate has accelerated for five consecutive quarters, hitting a rate of 43% year over year in the company's September-ended fourth fiscal quarter of 2016. Furthermore, Maestri emphasized that its services growth isn't just coming from the App Store. It's "several categories that are growing very well for us," Maestri said. With these optimistic trends in mind, the overall service segment should continue to grow robustly.

At about 13.5% of Apple's total revenue (up from 9.9% of revenue in the year-ago quarter), and considering the segment's recent rapid growth, the services segment is more important than ever for the company, especially as Apple's other product segments struggle to grow. Some Bad News for Apple Inc. In the fall of 2016, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introduced its next-generation iPhones, branded iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. These phones included a number of significant enhancements, such as more colorful and color-accurate displays, faster processors, improved cameras, stereo speakers, a solid-state home button, and faster wireless connectivity.

Indeed, aside from the fact that the look and feel of the devices were very similar to the prior two generations of iPhone models, the new devices represented significant upgrades from the prior-generation ones.

The new iPhone models seemed to be off to a good start, with Apple CEO Tim Cook saying on an October earnings call that the company, at the time, had yet to reach supply demand balance for its new phones.

Nevertheless, a recent report from BlueFin Research Partners, by way of Barron's, says that Apple has yet again cut its iPhone products plans, suggesting the new devices might not be able to keep sales momentum up until the company launches its next-generation iPhones in the fall.

Slashing estimates some more

BlueFin's initial iPhone unit shipment estimates for the March quarter sat at 59 million. That figure, if Apple were still on track to that goal, would have represented solid year-over-year growth from roughly 51 million units shipped in the March-ending quarter of the prior year, though still down from the roughly 61 million units that Apple shipped in the March-ending quarter of its fiscal 2015.

However, the analysts cut their estimates to 53 million last month, according to Barron's, and they're now taking those estimates to just 50 million units. If the analysts are right, then Apple might be looking at another -- albeit modest -- year-over-year decline in unit shipments during the March-ending quarter.

Considering that some of Apple's chief rivals, particularly in China, are posting substantial year-over-year smartphone unit growth -- and it's not all happening at the low end of the market -- it's starting to look as though this product cycle isn't going to be a particularly good one for Apple, either.

All eyes on the next cycle

Apple may have made a mistake in not significantly changing the look and feel of the iPhone models that launched in the fall. There had been rumors before the launches of those devices that Apple was looking to slim down the iPhone models significantly from the ones launched in the prior two cycles, but this ultimately didn't come to pass.

Apple is known to test out multiple different potential models before deciding on the final designs and putting them into mass production. Perhaps Apple found that it would have had to make too many technical sacrifices -- perhaps on battery life, processing power, or something else -- to slim down the phones, ultimately going with devices with a similar look and feel to the iPhone 6 series and iPhone 6s series.

It'll be interesting to see what Apple ultimately launches later this year, but consumers aren't responding to the numerous "under-the-hood" changes that the company introduced with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 7 series devices.

A fresh look and feel for its iPhone devices could be just what Apple needs to get its iPhone business back on a solid growth path. Why Apple Inc. Should Update the MacBook Pro Lineup in the Spring In October, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) finally rolled out long-awaited and much-anticipated updates to its MacBook Pro family of notebook computers. Both the 13-inch and 15-inch variants saw significant overhauls, including new track pads, faster processors, brighter and more colorful displays, and even the inclusion of a new touch bar on higher end 13-inch and all 15-inch models.

Image source: Apple.

The machines represented nice steps forward for the MacBook Pro lineup, which hadn't seen substantial updates for quite some time.

Nevertheless, I believe that Apple would be wise to update the lineup to include new processors as soon as possible, perhaps in a refresh in the March/April time frame. Here's why.

An easy update to the current lineup

The current MacBook Pro systems use Intel 's(NASDAQ: INTC) sixth-generation Core processors. Those chips first made their debut in the third quarter of 2015, but it took Apple a full year to adopt them in its systems.

The new chips, which you can read more about here , essentially deliver greater speed and improved video playback capabilities.

Those chips are also what is known as "pin compatible" with the prior generation sixth-generation Core processors, which means Apple wouldn't need to go and completely redesign its logic boards and systems to accommodate the new chips.

How much of an upgrade would these chips be?

The chips used in the current 13-inch MacBook Pro computers are the following, based on how much a customer is willing to pay:

Core i5-6267U (2.9GHz base/3.3GHz single core turbo/3.1GHz dual core turbo)

Core i5-6287U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.3GHz dual core turbo)

Core i7-6567U (3.3GHz base/3.6GHz single core turbo/3.4GHz dual core turbo)

The direct replacements for these chips from the seventh-generation Core processors are the following:

Core i5-7267U (3.1GHz base/3.5GHz single core turbo/3.5GHz dual core turbo)

Core i5-7287U (3.3GHz base/3.7GHz single core turbo/3.7GHz dual core turbo)

Core i7-7567U (3.5GHz base/4GHz single core turbo/3.9GHz dual core turbo)

The performance gains generation-over-generation here are significant, ranging from 12% to 15% in dual-core turbo speeds. That's on top of whatever gains in graphics and media capabilities that come with these chips.

Why Apple should update the systems ASAP

Although Apple does have the benefit of being the sole vendor of macOS-based computers, meaning that customers who want to buy computers that run macOS have no choice but to buy Apple's computers, there's little reason for the company to put itself at a competitive disadvantage relative to its Windows-based competitors.

Apple's Macs are generally competitive, well-built devices, boasting best-in-class components in areas such as track-pads, displays, keyboards, wireless connectivity, and industrial design.

However, I believe that Apple's MacBook product lines would be stronger if the company were quicker to adopt Intel's latest processors. Doing so might mean Apple pays a little bit more for processors (though I can't imagine the premium is significant), but a modest bill-of-materials increase is probably worth it, as the latest processors give Apple an additional marketing point and its competitors one less potential advantage.

Missed Last Fiscal Year Ahead of its annual shareholder meeting at the end of next month, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gone ahead and filed its proxy statement with the SEC. As usual for proxy statements, Apple is disclosing executive compensation levels for its most prominent executives, along with how it arrives at those levels. Following a relatively tough 2016 that included the first ever decline in iPhone unit sales, all executives including CEO Tim Cook saw pay reductions last year.

Apple's compensation committee sets out two critical performance targets each year to gauge the company's performance, and Apple fell short for 2016.

Top line and the almost-bottom line

More specifically, the two targets relate to top-line revenue and operating income, which is right above the bottom line before miscellaneous income and expenses as well as taxes are taken out. For each metric, Apple sets a threshold goal that must be exceeded for executives to receive their annual cash incentives. At that threshold, the cash bonus is equal to 100% of their respective base salaries. There is also a target goal that earns them 200% payouts, as well as a maximum goal that triggers a generous 400% payout.

Both revenue and operating income hit their threshold goals, but fell short of target goals. In the case of operating income, Apple only barely fell short. The company generated revenue of $215.6 billion in fiscal 2016, compared to the target goal of $223.6 billion. Operating income came in at $60 billion, just a hair shy of the target goal of $60.3 billion.

For context, Apple utterly hit it out of the park in 2015, exceeding its maximum goals for both metrics -- triggering those hefty 400% payouts in the process.

Fiscal 2015 Performance Revenue Operating Income Threshold Goal $188 billion $52.5 billion Target Goal $199 billion $55.1 billion Maximum Goal $210 billion $56.3 billion Actual $233.7 billion $71.2 billion

However, keep in mind that Cook got a $1 million raise to $3 million last year in terms of his base salary, which represented a 50% boost from 2015. That certainly softened the blow a bit. All told, Cook brought home $8.7 million last year, down from $10.3 million in 2015. The rest of the executive team's base salaries remained unchanged at a cool $1 million per year, although they all received $20 million equity grants in October 2015 (which is part of fiscal 2016).

It's all relative

Many of the equity grants that Apple executives receive are performance-based, being tied to how Apple shares perform relative to the S&P 500. This is measured in relative total stock return (TSR).

In a shareholder-friendly move a couple years ago, Cook chose to voluntarily modify his 2011 CEO grant to swap out time-based shares for performance-based RSUs. A year ago, I noted that Cook was facing a deadline in August 2016 and had a lot to lose if Apple continued to lag the broader market. Fortunately for Cook, shares bounced back and Apple's relative TSR scored well enough (78th percentile) for 280,000 RSUs to vest, the maximum allowed.

For the rest of the executive team and their October 2015 grants, here are the necessary relative TSR tiers and respective payouts.

Relative TSR vs. S&P 500 Companies Performance-based RSU Vesting as % of Target 85th or above 200% 55th 100% 25th 25% Below 25th 0%

As of the beginning of 2017, three executives had shares vest after Apple's relative TSR ranked it in the 83rd percentile.

Overall, Apple's compensation practices are quite aligned with shareholder interests. Not only does management have to deliver on fundamental performance, but Apple shares also need to fare well in order for executives to claim all of their eligible performance-based RSU grants. Apple Inc. Is The World's Greenest Tech Company: Here's Why On Tuesday, Greenpeace released their annual report of digital companies and their environmental impact and for the third year in a row, Apple topped the list. What sets Apple apart was their commitment to renewable energy, specifically in their offices and manufacturing sites. Other companies that were near the top were Google, Facebook and a data center operator called Switch. Near the bottom were video streaming companies like HBO, Netflix and Amazon. This is a result of the massive amount of electricity needed for their servers, which handle the streaming and transmitting of the videos.

Apple said to be working with Carl Zeiss to develop AR glasses

Apple is focusing its rumored interest in the augmented reality space on creating a new pair of AR glasses with Carl Zeiss, claims well-known blogger Robert Scoble in a Facebook post. Apple is said to have contacted suppliers about the project, which appears to be in the exploratory prototyping phase of development. While Scoble believes the glasses could be released in 2017, previous information points towards a 2018 or later release.

Apple, Inc.'s New Products: Everything You Need to Know As you might have heard, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just dropped some new products. The company, opting to announce the updates in a series of press releases on Tuesday, unveiled new versions of its iPhone and iPad, as well as a new app.

Here's a quick overview of the products and what they mean for Apple's business.

Special edition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7

While the most drastic update in terms of exterior appearance, Apple's new special addition (PRODUCT)RED iPhone 7 is essentially the same as the existing iPhone 7, except for its color and the exclusion of the base 64 GB storage tier. Like the jet black version of the iPhone 7, the new red iPhone is only available in 128 GB and 256 GB storage options.

As it does with all (PRODUCT)RED devices it has released over the 10 years it's participated in this initiative, Apple is contributing a portion of proceeds from sales of its special edition iPhone to the Global Fund, which is aimed at bringing "the world a step closer to an AIDS-free generation," according to the company.

Even after the donation to the Global Fund, this could serve as a slight catalyst for iPhone sales. In the past, the introduction of new iPhone colors has helped demand for the devices. Released about six months after the iPhone 7's launch, a new color could reinvigorate some consumer interest in the device. But since it's virtually the same phone as the iPhone 7, investors shouldn't expect any incremental sales to be very meaningful.

In another update to the iPhone lineup, Apple also doubled the storage options for its lower-cost iPhone SE from 16 GB and 64 GB to 32 GB to 128 GB.

An aggressively priced iPad

Apple also introduced a cheaper 9.7-inch iPad. Replacing its iPad Air 2, the new tablet -- simply called "iPad" -- is equipped with an improved A9 processor (the iPad Air 2 sported Apple's A8X chip), a brighter Retina display, and a higher storage capacity for the base version (32 GB versus 16 GB for the iPad Air 2).

But what's perhaps most surprising is the new iPad's aggressive pricing. The entry-level version of the tablet starts at $329, down from a $399 for the iPad Air 2.

Combining its improved specs and its lower price, the new iPad offers significantly more value than the previous iPad Air 2 and it has the potential to help give iPad sales a boost.

Clips: An expressive photo and video app

In a surprise move, Apple also announced an entirely new app called Clips. The video app helps users quickly make expressive videos on iPhone and iPad. The app is designed to create media well suited for social apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.

In addition to these updates, it also launched some new accessories, including new Apple Watch band designs and new silicone and leather iPhone 7 case colors.

Overall, none of Apple's updates were enough to substantially move the needle. But they should at least help the company create some incremental interest as the tech giant readies more extensive product updates in the future. Hackers Demand Ransom From Apple Inc. Alleged hackers calling themselves the Turkish Crime Family have demanded that Apple pay ransom in exchange for the massive amounts of email account information and iCloud data they claim to have. They say they will remotely wipe hundreds of millions of Apple customers  iPhones unless the company pays $75,000 in one of two forms of crypto-currency or hands over $100,000 in iTunes gift cards.

Supposed hackers issue demands to Apple

The group reportedly contacted Motherboard and said they had issued their demands to Apple. They want either $75,000 in bitcoin or ethereum or $100,000 in iTunes gift card in exchange for deleting the data they claim to have. If the iPhone maker doesn t pay up by April 7, the Turkish Crime Family claims it will remotely wipe its victims  iPhones on that date.

The group said it had showed Apple a YouTube video which showed how they were able to break into one of the accounts they had hacked into. In that video, the hackers appear to be breaking into an iCloud account owned by an elderly woman and accessing her backed-up photos. The hackers also showed Motherboard the video and a number of screenshots.

They also reportedly gave the website access to one of the email accounts the hackers said they used to communicate with Apple. Motherboard viewed what the hackers claim were messages exchanged with Apple s security team, although one of the messages the supposed hackers shared was sent only via a screenshot. The website did not see the original email.

Is there reason to panic?

On one hand, you might think that hackers who really had something on Apple would demand much more than what this group wants, but on the other, if you re an iPhone or iPad user, you may be concerned. However, Motherboard points out that the hackers  claims were inconsistent. It s also very easy to fake the so-called  evidence  it was presented.

For example, in one of the emails the website viewed in the account it saw, the group claimed to have access to more than 300 million Apple email accounts, including some with @me and @icloud domains. Another time, the group claimed to have had access to 559 million accounts. The group also didn t give Motherboard access to any of the email accounts it supposedly had hacked into other than those it showed in the video it uploaded to YouTube.

Motherboard adds that the email account the group gave it access to appears to have sent messages to multiple other media outlets, possibly to pressure Apple. Whether or not the group s demands are real, users can always reset their passwords and security information. It s also a good idea to enable two-factor authentication, which makes it much more difficult for your account to be breached. Will Trump Approve The Apple Buyback?

Plus, he added, Apple is poised to benefit "significantly" from potential changes in the laws for bringing back foreign cash. Though Apple has long had a mountain of cash on hand, investors now see it as more valuable, Sacconaghi said.

This is a common assumption by Wall Street analysts, that Apple will repatriate some or all of its $90B in cash from overseas and initiate a big buyback.

As one of the richest, most visible companies in the world, this is a high-profile political event both for the company and for the Trump administration. And the political uncertainty surrounding the details of the final "deal" or agreement is anything but certain.

The backdrop to this negotiation is increasing pressure on the company to build more factories here and create jobs.

Apple may be renowned for its attention to detail, but there's something major missing from its process: American workers, former AOL president Ted Leonsis said.

The political purpose of repatriating cash is to create American manufacturing jobs. The significant question for shareholders is how does a de facto tax break for one of the richest companies in America to do a stock buyback help President Trump? It doesn't. In fact, a stock buyback is designed to benefit one group: shareholders. Large shareholders who now include outspoken critic of President Trump, Warren Buffett. I expect this to be a negotiation, and potentially, a contentious one.

Political Realities

Therefore, the political realities of this negotiation are riskier than most Wall Street analysts expect. At a minimum, the company will need to announce some type of large manufacturing move to the United States, and or other political concessions. Or, it might not happen at all. The only benefit to the president of repatriated cash is the potential for new jobs and growth in the economy.

The idea that Apple is going to repatriate this money and do a large buyback without significant concessions is incredibly naive in the current political climate.

In fact, one of the biggest beneficiaries of a big Apple buyback would be Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) and billionaire Warren Buffett. Mr. Buffett campaigned aggressively for Hillary Clinton, famously accusing President Trump of having no decency. It is politically naive to think that this large potential benefit to Apple's shareholders will be simple or easy.

Last bear gives up.

Still, Sacconaghi said Apple will need to continue adding new products to remain relevant. Despite raising his price target, Sacconaghi knocked 10 cents off his estimates for the March quarter, according to FactSet.

The analyst is now so bullish on Apple that he cut his estimate by 10 cents. Make up your own mind how "bullish" this analyst actually is. Previously, Sacconaghi has said Apple's best days are behind it, and that it's unclear whether it will be a growth company in five years. But on Tuesday, Sacconaghi said Apple's stock is relatively cheap by some of Wall Street's measures.

Significant Timing

An astute investor should not miss the significance of today's events: the last bear reaching "max pain" and upgrading the shares, the shares hitting all time highs of $142.80, and then a large volume selloff with the general market action.

In fact, today's reversal both in the market and in Apple's shares has the potential of a major sentiment change.

Can the News Get Any Better?

Today's volume of 39M shares, which has been lagging the entire move the last 30 days, has picked up significantly to the downside. Doubling yesterday's volume. Institutions now realize with every analyst on Wall Street firmly in the bull camp, positive stories from Barron's and Warren Buffett, and shares leading the market the past month, that a majority of good news has been priced into Apple's shares. Shares trade at a five-year high of 15x earnings (MarketSmith/IBD)

Technical Overview

As of the close today, with the shares at $139.84 (Tuesday 3/21), they are right on the 10-day moving average of $139.81. A move below this level suggests a move to the 50-day level of support at $131.22.

Recommendation

Investors who are bullish Apple: For those holding shares, I would recommend selling the $140 April 28 calls for $3.50. This will provide some downside protection as well as enhance returns if the shares simply trade sideways and consolidate the recent gains.

I believe the shares are headed to the 50-day support at $131, so investors could also consider more protection provided by selling the $135 calls.

Bearish Apple

Buy the Apple April 28 $135 Puts for $1.45

Sell the Apple April 28 $130 put for .60

The shares look headed to $130, so the cost of this position is only .80. If the shares were to trade down to $130 (a 7.65% pullback), the position would be worth $4.80 or a gain of 600%.

Conclusion

The repatriation of cash by Apple is much more complicated than most investors realize. The political event will require Apple to make concessions to the president in terms of manufacturing plants and jobs. It is likely to be a negotiation and could be more politically complicated than previously thought.

Today's market events signify a number of important sentiment changes: the last bear giving up, shares reversing in high volume, and the market also reversing sharply.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Invest Like Ken Fisher: Apple Inc. (AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Facebook ... Billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Fisher is feeling bullish about the state of the market- a sentiment reflected in his fourth-quarter trades when he upped positions in key stocks such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB).

Fisher is a long-time stock market expert. Not only is he Forbes  longest-running columnist, but he is also the author of 11 books and the executive chairman and co-chief investment of Fisher Asset Management fund. The fund, which Fisher founded with just $250 in 1979, is now one of the largest funds in the world with a portfolio value of $57.43 billion.

 A primary feature in my brain has always been the question  What can you fathom others find unfathomable?  Fisher said recently. So it s perhaps not surprising that Fisher has recently been busy writing about how its  backwards  to think that in the current climate  normal investors  should wait for prices to fall.

Instead he tells the Financial Times:  Stocks aren t overvalued. Valuation techniques are.  Fisher s message to investors? If you need long-term growth, your default asset allocation should be stock-heavy as  no other liquid asset has approached stocks  10 percent annualized return since 1926, which includes 13 bear markets. 

As this TipRanks graph shows, Fisher s strategy has seen the fund considerably outperform the average hedge fund for 2017, 2016 and part of 2015- although it continues to lag the measured performance of the S&P 500.

Indeed, the fund s average returns (based on the weighted portfolio performance of 651 stocks) are relatively impressive: in the last quarter, the fund saw an average return of 5.58%. This rises to 17.82% for the last year and 11.51% over an annualized three-year time period.

Now let s dig deeper into three of Fisher s most interesting Q4 moves:

Apple Inc.

In Q4, Fisher increased the fund s Apple holding by 1.11% to 11.5 million shares with a reported value of $1.33 billion making Apple the fund s third biggest stock.

Already since the last filing date the shares have gained over 20% in value. And there is much further to go if Bernstein s top analyst Toni Sacconaghi is to be believed. This famous Apple bear has recently had a change of heart about the future of the consumer giant, raising his AAPL price target to $160 on March 21.

Sacconaghi is predicting great things for Apple s iPhone 8 which is due to be released in September this year with a radical redesign, telling CNBC that the iPhone 8 cycle will be significant. He says  we believe that users have been holding off   that the last two products have been relatively incremental and evolutionary, and that the iPhone 8 will be a significant form factor change. 

Although the analyst maintained a slightly bearish note with his warning that Apple has seen its best days, he is bullish on the benefit to Apple from changing tax laws on cash repatriation as well as the potential from augmented reality which could drive a new wave of popularity for Apple s gaming apps. Ultimately he says that in order to remain relevant, Apple will have to keep updating its product portfolio.

TipRanks exhibits a moderate buy analyst consensus rating for Apple with 28 buy ratings, 6 hold ratings and 2 sell ratings published on the stock in the last three months. The average analyst price target of $150 suggests that Apple has further upside potential from the current share price of 6.5%.

NVIDIA Corporation

In Q4 Fisher initiated a new position in chipmaker Nvidia with 2,249 shares that have a reported value of $240,000. Since the last filing date prices of the stock have dropped marginally by 0.65%.

Top Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated his buy rating on the stock two days ago with a $130 price target (21% upside) following the recent NVDA Deep Learning Connect conference in London.

After the conference, Hari wrote this analysis of why Nvidia s management libraries (a C-based API for monitoring and managing various states of the NVIDIA GPU devices) and the support of customers, is so important:  by growing its sales and support capability, NVDA can create sticky relationships with customers in verticals outside of cloud, in our view (note customers outside of the cloud space are more likely to depend on such support from NVDA .

The analyst adds that this tactic gained Nvidia considerable success in gaming, and that Nvidia s plan to increase spending over the next few quarters could help drive similar results in the data center, enterprise and automotive businesses.

Nvidia has a moderate buy analyst consensus rating on TipRanks with an average analyst price target of $117.100- which represents a 9.7% upside from the current share price.

Facebook Inc

Fisher boosted the fund s Facebook holding by 7.37% in Q4 to 255,638 shares worth $29.4 million. The shares have appreciated in value by 20.39% since the last filing date.

Four-star BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield admitted he had been wrong about the stock as he upgraded FB to buy on March 21 with a $175 price target.  Not having a Buy on Facebook has clearly been a mistake in 2017 and we are simply not going to allow that mistake to continue,  said Greenfield.

 Over the past several months, it has become increasingly clear that Instagram Stories is an overwhelming success story for Facebook  Greenfield added. The analyst also referred to Facebook video and the continued shift of advertising to mobile platforms as catalysts for the social media giant s success. BTIG is now estimating revenue of $38.7 billion for Facebook in 2017, 40% up from their previous estimate.

BTIG is now in line with the vast majority of analysts: Facebook has a strong buy consensus rating on TipRanks with 34 buy ratings and only 2 hold ratings published on the stock in the last three months. In terms of average analyst price target, we can see that there is a potential 16.5% upside from the current share price of $139.

Pay Attention To How The Stock Reacts To The News:

From where I sit, the most important trait I look for during earnings season is how the market and a specific company reacts to the news. Remember, always keep your losses small and never argue with the tape.

Get The Strongest Stocks Of 2017 - Click Here Apple Inc. Reportedly Prepping 3 New iPhones for March Launch Per a new report from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)-centric website Macotakara (via MacRumors), Apple is prepping a couple of "new" iPhone models. The first is a variant of the company's relatively low-cost, small-screen iPhone SE with 128 gigabytes of storage (current models come with either 16 or 64 gigabytes of storage).

Additionally, Apple is reportedly planning to add new red variants of both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to its lineup.

Let's take a closer look at what these new products could potentially do for the company's iPhone business.

The new iPhone SE could help boost blended average selling prices...or unit shipments

On Apple's April 2016 earnings call, company CEO Tim Cook explained that the iPhone SE "is attracting two types of customers."

The first set, he explained, are "customers that wanted the latest technology but wanted it in a more compact package."

"We clearly see even more people than we thought in that category," Cook added.

The second set of potential iPhone SE customers, per Cook, were individuals "who aspire to own an iPhone but couldn't quite stretch to the entry price of the iPhone, and we've established a new entry [with the iPhone SE]."

The iPhone SE with 16 gigabytes of storage currently sells for $399, with the 64-gigabyte version coming in at $449; the iPhone 6s with 32 gigabytes of storage sells for $549.

With this rumored 128-gigabyte iPhone SE, Apple has two potential ways to try to boost revenue.

The first is that it can simply ax the 16-gigabyte iPhone SE model and offer the 64-gigabyte version at the $399 price point and the 128-gigabyte variant at the $449 price point that the 64-gigabyte version currently occupies.

That course of action has the potential to reduce blended average selling prices (perhaps as mix shifts down to the $399 64-gigabyte version), but it could also boost overall unit demand as value-oriented customers may be more inclined to grab an iPhone.

Alternatively, Apple could simply add the 128-gigabyte iPhone SE to the current lineup and charge, perhaps $549 for it. This might not stimulate a lot more unit demand, but it could have the effect of getting the portion of the iPhone SE-buying population that is buying the iPhone SE for form factor and not for cost reasons to buy a richer mix of products, helping to boost blended average selling prices.

It'll be interesting to see what Apple's ultimate go-to-market strategy will be for this product -- assuming it's real.

iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus in rouge

Apple has been steadily adding new color choices to its iPhone lineup over the years. In 2013, Apple introduced gold, in 2015 we got rose gold, and in 2016 we got black and jet black. It's looking as though we're getting red this year.

It's not clear how much impact bringing red color models into the lineup will have on overall sales; after all, are there truly potential customers out there that haven't purchased a new iPhone but totally would have purchased an iPhone if only it had come in red?

For what it's worth, in a poll run by 9to5Mac, 106 voters out of a total of 15,558 said that they were most excited about a red option coming to the iPhone 8 -- losing to all other potential options except for "speed improvements."

We'll see if the introduction of red iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus has any real impact on iPhone sales soon enough, if this rumor turns out to be true. Is Apple A Good Investment At Over USD 700 Billion? Apple is obviously a company that everyone knows about, but is it a good investment at over USD 700 billion?

I will start a discussion with Charlie Munger's advice: Invert, always invert - turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don't we want to go, and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how to fail. Here is a list of how could Apple fail:

Technology is difficult and Apple will eventually lose the war - if you make 50% of the profit from the product which you don't know how it is going to look like in 5 to 10 years, it should not be considered a good investment. Technology is the game in which you don't know who is going to be the winner.

Competitors have substantially narrowed the gap between the quality of their smartphones and the iPhone.

Glory days are over - according to a paper published by Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, mobile penetration in the US and Europe's Big Five Countries (EU5) has reached 91%, and in urban China, that number has risen to 97%. Nearly everyone now has a mobile phone, 65% of Americans, 74% of Europeans, and 72% of urban Chinese consumers own a smartphone. With this kind of market penetration already in place, the big question is where future sales will come from?

Every other year, for nearly a decade now, Apple has released a redesigned, updated version of its iPhone smartphone - but is that possible to sustain in the future? It seems that a customer who once bought a phone every 2 years is now a once every 4 years buyer.

Android's open ecosystem allows for better integration comparing iOS.

The math is certainly getting tougher - Apple is one of the biggest success stories, no doubt about it. But with a market value of over $700 billion, it is going to be very difficult to compound further to $1.5 trillion.

More or less all of those arguments we can find around Apple. But let's look at the other side of the story:

Apple is the most valuable brand in the world. Here is excerpt from The Little Book That Builds Wealth "One of the most common mistakes investors make concerning brands is assuming that a well-known brand endows its owner with a competitive advantage. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. A brand creates an economic moat only if it increases the consumer's willingness to pay or increases customer captivity". I think Apple brand does both.

Apple is not a hardware manufacturer, it is a consumer brand. Apple simply buys raw material and sell brands.

Apple possesses something unique comparing to its competitors.

The pace of technology change is rapid, but Apple has the ability to produce what customers will buy. For instance, Apple was not the frontrunner in the watch business, nevertheless, they are now the second largest watch company.

Smartphones are a central part of our daily life, therefore, there is a great opportunity to monetize that fact. There are now over 1 billion Apple devices that are actively being used around the world.

Apple's service revenue is a great business (recurring, growing and high margin). This year we can expect close to $30 billion in revenue. Apple takes a 30% share of that revenue, and that goes straight to the bottom line.

And so on.

How should we think about valuation?

Since no firm can grow forever at a high rate many of them face a slowdown. Some of them never achieve the previous status, some of them find a new revenue source, while some of them simply fail. Instead of trying to estimate the growth five or ten years into the future, then determine the proper discount rate and terminal growth rate, I will use reverse DCF model. This method takes the current share price and backs out what is currently implied. Then growth rate estimate can be assessed if it is sustainable or not.

Here is a summary of reverse DCF model:

A Reverse DCF model is not perfect but it helps us in many ways. This model solves the problem of not being able to forecast the future, but it doesn't tackle the discount rate problems and terminal estimate. To simplify the model I use 10% discount rate and terminal FCF multiple of 12x. It is no clear if Apple would return its international cash and what would be tax rate at the end I use the stated figures from the balance sheet. Overall, based on the 1-stage reverse DCF model I get implied growth rate of 0.4%. I think the valuation is still quite reasonable.

To Sum Up

Both sides of arguments are quite strong, thus investing is far more art than it is science. Having said that, you need to find something intangible in the company. When you observe the behavior of Apple's customers, it becomes clear that the company has something unique that competitors lack. In my view simplicity is at the heart of the company's products and the foundation for the future. Despite some challenges from time to time, I don't see any other technology creating a simple experience as good as Apple. That said, when I analyze Apple my main question is their ability to keep its obsession with simplicity.

There were a lot of discussions about Berkshire Hathaway decision to buy Apple shares, but this is just performance of simplicity in investing. Munger says that the best way to achieve success is by avoiding failures. He implies that it is not brilliance that made Berkshire Hathaway succeed. They consistently avoided stupidity. Those three sentences best describe the recent purchase of Apple's shares.

It doesn't matter if you create iPhone or invest several billion in stocks, those that deliver simplicity are the ones who win in the end. Apple's Appeal To Reason Technology business briefs for February 21, 2017.

Apple Files Its EU Tax Appeal

Source: 9to5Mac

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) position on taxation has clearly evolved since 2013 when CEO Tim Cook went before a Senate Subcommittee and declared, "We pay all the taxes we owe."

Strictly speaking, the statement might have been true, but Apple's position on the tax status of its overseas cash has clearly become more nuanced following the decision of the European Commission to try to compel Ireland to collect roughly $14 billion it says is owed to Ireland, even though Ireland made it clear that it disagreed with the EU.

How it came to pass that the EU would attempt to compel Ireland to collect tax against its will I described in detail back in August. To summarize, the European Union is powerless to tax Apple itself. Therefore, the executive branch of the EU, the European Commission, is attempting to resort to the next best thing, which is to use Ireland as a tax collecting proxy.

As I pointed out at the time, this action was fraught with all manner of ramifications for the EU and the sovereignty of its members. The EU is formally a treaty organization, not an international government, but there has always been an internationalist sentiment within EU administrators that sought to expand the power of the EU. The Apple taxation case is just one example.

The EU's action brought it into direct conflict with the US Government, which rightfully claimed that any tax owed by Apple's Irish subsidiaries was properly due the US. The Treasury Department released a white paper on the subject in which it implied that the EU was picking the pocket of US Government by collecting taxes properly owed to the US.

There's a tremendous amount of detail and legal argument that I'm glossing over, but when one steps back and looks at the big picture, the issue really is simply to whom the tax is owed. How much tax is owed is really a function of to whom it is owed. This was my conclusion as of December.

Then I had pointed out that statements by Bruce Sewell, Apple's General Counsel, implied that Apple was starting to base its case on this fundamental principle. As such it represents an evolution of Apple's position from "we don't owe any tax" to "we owe the US the tax, not the EU."

This concept has now become the cornerstone of the Apple appeal to the EU. Although the appeal document puts forth a number of arguments (in an appeal, you use every argument available), but the key point is made in the third argument:

The Commission made fundamental errors by failing to recognize that the applicants' profit-driving activities, in particular the development and commercialisation of intellectual property ('Apple IP'), were controlled and managed in the United States. The profits from those activities were attributable to the United States, not Ireland.

Or, the EU for that matter.

Why the evolution? Part of this must be due to the perception that Apple now has a good chance of repatriation under the Trump administration at a reasonable (10% proposed) tax rate. The other consideration is that Apple needs the US Government on its side in the matter. Aligning with the USG's position is the best way to recruit the political assistance of the government.

Things could still go south for Apple in the appeal. The EU might persist despite US opposition, or the European Court of Justice might still rule against Ireland (which also appealed the decision). But I now consider the chances of a successful appeal to be good.

Intel Announces New Mobile Chips Ahead of Mobile World Congress

Mobile World Congress (MWC) is the annual convention sponsored by the GSM Association and attended by just about everyone in the cellular communications field including carriers and device makers. Except Apple, that is.

Usually, a lot of smartphones get announced at or in conjunction with MWC, and now Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is making its presence felt as well with a number of mobile device related chip announcements. An editorial by Aicha Evans, Intel's head of the Communications and Devices Group, today touted Intel's work in 5G, as well as a new modem.

The modem is the XMM 7560 which will be fabricated on Intel's 14 nm process and be the first Intel modem to feature download speeds of 1 Gbps via some advanced LTE features. Over a year ago, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) had announced its own Snapdragon X16 modem with 1 Gbps download speed over LTE. The time difference between the announcements reflects the relative state of modem development between the two companies.

Not that it made a great deal of difference to consumers. Most of the LTE infrastructure of the wireless carriers isn't able to support the advanced features needed by these modems. And it was only in October 2016 that Qualcomm was able to announce a device that used the X16. This wasn't a smartphone, but a Netgear mobile router.

The competition between Qualcomm and Intel has pushed the chipmakers out in front of the wireless carriers, but this was inevitable. Eventually, the carriers will catch up and the chipmakers will have modems waiting for them in future smartphones. It's only a matter of time.

In the meantime, Intel and Qualcomm race to push 5G development, with both claiming "leadership." In fact, Intel's leadership is mostly about collaboration with infrastructure partners, but Intel did finally come up with a 5G modem (announcement) of its own, following Qualcomm's X50 5G modem announcement last October.

So far, it's a battle of announcements, with neither chip available at this time. Qualcomm has stated that its X50 modem will begin sampling in the second half of 2017.

Qualcomm Announces the X20 Modem

Not to be outdone by Intel, Qualcomm today announced its successor to the X16, the Snapdragon X20 modem. The X20 will be based on a 10 nm process, probably Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF), and feature a slight download speed bump to 1.2 Gbps.

One might wonder what the point of the X20 is at this time, given the lack of support for the X16. I think there are two key motivations for the X20, and both revolve around coaxing carriers and handset makers to support gigabit LTE speeds.

For the handset makers, the use of the 10 nm process allows the modem to operate more efficiently, making it more attractive to incorporate into flagship devices where battery life is always a concern. For the carriers, it offers them the prospect of a relatively easy upgrade path to gigabit performance through the use of unlicensed spectrum.

We'll have to see if the strategy pays off, but certainly carriers are now under pressure to provide higher download speeds to support HD video and even virtual reality. Qualcomm is trying to get position on this nascent market as well as facilitate carrier adoption. The X20 is already sampling to OEMs and it expects the first commercial devices in H1 2018, which gives you some idea of the time frame for carrier roll-out of gigabit services.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Target Boosted For China Potential, Market Multiple Analysts from at least two firms have raised their price targets for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, with one reassuring investors that China sales will recover in fiscal 2018 and the other boosting her target for higher multiples. Interestingly, the two analysts disagree about whether the iPhone 8 cycle will be a  super cycle  or not.

Apple (AAPL) stock to $154 for China

Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty nudged her price target on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock up from $150 to $154 based on a higher estimate for iPhone 8 unit numbers. The general consensus in the tech and financial worlds is that the company will release two standard upgrades (the iPhone 7s and 7s Plus) and one higher-end upgrade with an AMOLED display. The iPhone 8 is believed to be a special tenth anniversary addition with a load of new features, including a curved form factor, battery life improvements, wireless charging, 3D sensors, better artificial intelligence software and more.

The core of Huberty s bullish thesis is China, where the base of older iPhones is quite large.

She analyzed the number of older iPhones, loyalty rates and purchase intention share for various brands in China and now believes that two main factors will drive growth there in fiscal 2018. Her view also runs against the Street s concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL) s diving sales in China.

Apple (AAPL) may steal from other brands

The first is that the size of the older iPhone base sets the market up for major upgrades. The iPhone took off in 2015, the first year a new iPhone was launched on China Mobile s network. This means that the base of iPhones that are two years old is more than double the last  supercycle. 

Huberty s AlphaWise smartphone survey found a 74% retention rate for Apple Inc. (AAPL), and even after that, the number of expected upgrades reaches 43 million, which is double from 2016.

The Morgan Stanley analyst also believes the iPhone maker will take users from Chinese smartphone brands, as her survey suggests one-fifth of Chinese users with a domestic brand smartphone will switch to an iPhone when they buy their next device.

Based on these two factors, she now estimates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) will ship 72 million iPhones in China in fiscal 2016, compared to the current run-rate of 27 million. However, Wall Street is only looking for a global increase of 19 million iPhones. Based on this upside, Huberty s bull case for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock now stands at $190 per share if the company s iPhone shipments reach the high end of her estimate range, which stands at 20% to 30% growth globally. For the full year, she expects global iPhone shipments of 260 million, which is toward the low end of that range.

Apple (AAPL) stock target boosted but Hold rating reiterated

Huberty reiterated her Overweight rating on Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, while Deutsche Bank analyst Sherri Scribner maintained her Hold rating. However, Scribner also raised her price target for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock, moving from $115 to $125 per share. And while Huberty continues to argue the iPhone 8  supercycle  case, Scribner feels that the next iPhone cycle will be  hardly a  super cycle.' 

Her view contrasts with Huberty s views quite nicely, as she is cautious about the widespread argument for an installed base that s ripe for an upgrade. She noted that the global smartphone market has been decelerating, and refresh cycles have been getting longer.

Deutsche Bank s supply chain checks suggest 134.5 million iPhone units will be produced in the second half of this year, a 5% increase from the first half. It would be good, as last year s supply chain shipments fell 12% from the first to second half of the year. However, in previous years, iPhone production grew by more than 20% year over year in the second half, which she said is  a far cry from what many are calling a  super cycle.' 

iPhone 8 demand may be limited by price

Scribner is also concerned about the reports that the iPhone 8 will be priced between $900 and $1,000, as she isn t sure many consumers will be willing or able to fork over so much money for their next phone.

She feels such a high price will limit demand, even though it should help average selling prices. She estimates that smartphones priced at or above $700 were only 10% of the total units shipped last year, and this part of the market declined 19% year over year. Further, the average selling price for a new phone in the fourth quarter was only $303.

The Deutsche Bank analyst feels that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock is fully valued right now, although she boosted her price target because market multiples have moved higher. Shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock ticked higher by as much as 0.41% to $136.28 during regular trading hours on Tuesday.

Why Apple, Inc. Stock Gained 11% in 2016 What happened

Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) finished 2016 strong, gaining about 5.8%. The nice increase toward the end of the year helped the stock clock a 10.9% rise during the year, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. While the increase is notable, investors should put the move into perspective by considering that the S&P 500 increased by about the same amount during this period.

So what

Apple's gain for the year didn't come without some volatility. In May, the stock had fallen about 12.5% as investors considered the implications of the company's falling revenue and earnings per share. Concern particularly mounted after Apple reported its fiscal second-quarter results in April, highlighting a 13% year-over-year decline in revenue and an 18% year-over-year decline in earnings per share. Investors also questioned the company's ability to grow revenue and EPS from current levels.

But as the year went on, signs that Apple's iPhone 7 launch may be faring well, optimism about the company's 2017 iPhone launch, and Samsung's Note 7 recall all gave investors reasons to be more optimistic -- not to mention Apple's conservative stock price, which arguably already prices in business growth headwinds.

Now what

Going into 2017, the best thing Apple stock has going for it is its valuation. The stock trades with a price-to-earnings ratio of just 14. This compares to the average 25 P/E of stocks in the S&P 500. While it's impossible to speculate where the stock will go in 2017, Apple stock looks compelling with a valuation like this. Apple: 200 Billion Reasons To Ignore The Nikkei iPhone Report

Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Will Keep Thriving Off Its Strong App Economy It s good to be an app developer for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ). Last year, the earnings came to a whopping $20 billion, up 40% on a year-over-year basis. In all, there are 2.2 million apps in the App Store. Of course, AAPL stock got a nice benefit from this since the company gets a cut from each download.

The estimate is that the gross revenues were approximately $8 billion.

Granted, for a company at the scale of Apple, this may not necessarily seem like a lot. In 2016, the company posted revenues for $215.6 billion. The fact is that the main driver continues to be the iPhone franchise.

Yet, the Apple App Store is still vitally important and it should provide some fuel for growth. Consider that many of the downloads are from highly popular games, such as Pokemon Go and Super Mario Run.

If anything, as the iPhone gets more sophisticated, this category will likely see continued strong monetization. According to research from Ovum, the spending on gaming is forecasted to jump from $38.5 billion in 2016 to $71.5 billion in 2021.

But then again, the power of the App Store should go well beyond gaming. For example, one driver has been the substantial growth in streaming services, such as Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ).

AAPL and App Power

Keep in mind that AAPL has been working hard on building its platform. For example, it has a new language, called Swift, which allows for building sophisticated apps.

At the same time, Apple has been developing various app frameworks, such as Healthkit, Homekit, Apple Pay, Sirikit and so on. All these should allow the company to get a piece of the revenue opportunity from the digitization of key industries.

For example, APPL is already making a big play for healthcare. To this end, the company is developing a diagnostic system within Healthkit that will be tied to the Watch.

The Most Cash That Apple, Inc. Has Ever Had You'd think that after returning over $200 billion in cash to investors through its capital return program over the past five years, that there'd be a sizable dent in Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) money mountain. You'd be wrong.

To be clear, Apple's cash position would certainly be about $200 billion more if it weren't for the program, but the fact still stands that Apple generates so much cash that it simply can't give that money back fast enough. Operating cash flow was $65.8 billion in fiscal 2016, which ended in September. Even after deducting $12.8 billion in capital expenditures, the Mac maker enjoyed $53 billion in free cash flow -- leaving plenty to cover the $12.2 billion paid out in dividends and dividend equivalents and buying back $30 billion worth of stock. The same is true for the most recent fiscal first quarter.

Here's the thing: It's also true for almost every year since Apple started returning capital. Capital returns have exceeded 100% of free cash flow in only one fiscal year since the program commenced (2014, and only by about 12%). The net result is that despite the massive amounts of capital being returned, Apple now has the most cash it's ever had on the balance sheet. For a company that loves superlatives as much as Apple does, it's almost surprising that it didn't point this out on last month's earnings call.

Cash is king

As of the end of 2016, Apple was sitting on $246 billion in total cash, which is the highest its cash position has ever been. Even if you were to factor in debt, which is predominantly used to fund the capital return program, and look at Apple's cash position on a net basis, that's also the highest it's ever been. Despite its best efforts to return as much as possible, Apple's cash keeps marching higher. Gross cash and net cash begin to diverge in 2013 when Apple starts taking on debt, but you can see both are at all-time highs.

It's also true that Apple's cash is increasingly concentrated abroad, as the debt is used as a way to avoid repatriation taxes. At this point, 94% of Apple's total cash is held by foreign subsidiaries. This figure was closer to 60% half a decade ago.

What comes next

Given this, combined with the fact that Apple is currently reviewing its capital return plans and will give investors an update in April, there seems to be plenty of room for Apple to get even more aggressive if it wants to. When it launched the capital return program, it finally acknowledged years of criticisms that the company had way more cash than it would ever conceivably need -- and it currently has about $60 billion more (or about 50%) net cash than when it started capital returns.

The curve ball is the practical limit on how much debt Apple should take on. If the company can convince the Trump administration to deliver on that repatriation holiday promise, that could potentially pave the way for some type of massive return or special dividend. Otherwise, that money mountain is only getting bigger. Apple Inc.'s Mac Is Back on Track For a while there, Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac business was really struggling. Not only was it a victim of a generally weak personal-computer market, but a stale product line in the face of aggressive moves from competing computer vendors also led the company to underperform the broader market.

That, by the way, is a nice way of saying the company lost market share.

Last October, though, Apple finally launched new MacBook Pro machines. It updated both its 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro lines, and because of all the new features it packed into these updated systems, the company charged higher prices for them than it did for the prior-generation models.

Now that Apple's first-quarter financial results are out -- the first quarter in which the company would recognize revenue for the new systems -- investors can get an idea of how well customers have received the new systems.

And, perhaps unsurprisingly, things are looking good.

Putting Mac back on a growth path

Apple reported shipping 5.37 million Macs in the first quarter of its fiscal year 2017, netting $7.24 billion in revenue from those sales. Mac unit shipments were up from the 5.31 million Apple shipped in the prior-year period, amounting to 1.1% growth.

That's not a huge amount of growth, but considering the 10% unit decline that Apple's Mac business suffered last year, that's an improvement.

Though unit growth was positive but anemic, the revenue growth story was completely different. Apple's Mac revenue in its most recent quarter was up 7% year over year, implying a solid increase in Mac average selling prices.

"The Mac not only returned to growth but generated its highest quarterly revenue ever," Apple CEO Tim Cook proclaimed on the company's first-quarter earnings call.

It's still early in the current MacBook Pro product cycle, but it seems customers were willing to pay extra for the added features and technologies Apple added to its latest MacBook Pro machines.

Apple knows what it must do

I'd hazard a guess that it won't take any miracles or game-changing innovations to allow Apple's Mac product line to continue to at least perform in line with the personal-computer market. Apple simply needs to make sure it provides regular updates to its Mac products so the lineup doesn't get stale.

These regular updates can be as simple as adopting the latest processors and adding other technological improvements, though obviously the bigger and more interesting the changes -- think the Touch Bar, the Force Touch trackpad, and so on -- the better.

The Mac doesn't make up a huge portion of Apple's annual revenue. Mac sales made up less than 10% of Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue, though this percentage is bound to increase as Apple moves past the peak iPhone quarter. And when taken in conjunction with Apple's other non-iPhone products, it's still a reasonable contributor to revenue.

Further, much has been said about the strength of Apple's ecosystem and the company's ability to build products that work well together. If the company can sell more Macs, then that might also translate into customers who will switch to -- or stick with -- Apple's iPhone.

Apple should do its very best to make sure all of the elements of its ecosystem are strong, to maximize the potential value it can extract from said ecosystem. How Apple, Inc.'s Share Repurchases Are Driving Record Results Many investors don't fully appreciate just how powerful Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) share repurchase program is, or how tangible its benefits are. This is one of (if not the) most accretive capital return programs out there, simply by virtue of its size.

Most of the time, companies opt to merely offset the dilution associated with stock-based compensation to employees. But Apple buys back its stock hand over fist, and the result is a significant reduction in shares outstanding. Look no further than Apple's share count since its capital return program started back in late 2012.

To date, Apple has now cumulatively repurchased an incredible $143.7 billion in less than five years. That's larger than the market caps of many mature megacap companies (those worth over $100 billion). As of right now, Apple's board has authorized $175 billion in share repurchases, and the company provides annual updates to its capital return program every April.

The company has tended to allocate more of its capital return program toward repurchases, confident that shares are undervalued. I'd expect the board to do likewise for 2017.

Record EPS, brought to you by share buybacks

Apple noted that it set several records last quarter, including revenue records for many of its most important businesses. Earnings per share also hit a new all-time quarterly record of $3.36, despite the fact that net income was down modestly in dollar terms at $17.9 billion.

Metric Q4 2015 Q4 2016 Net income $18.4 billion $17.9 billion Diluted EPS $3.28 $3.36 Shares used in diluted EPS 5.59 billion 5.33 billion

In no uncertain terms, the aggressive share repurchase activity led to a meaningful reduction in shares outstanding, which is what allowed Apple to post its highest quarterly EPS ever. That's what I call earnings accretion. For shareholders, a record bottom line is as tangible as it gets.

Android projected to top Apple in app revenue for first time this year Android users will spend more money on apps and subscriptions than users of Apple Inc. s products for the first time in 2017, according to a report released Wednesday.

App Annie, which focuses on data related to the mobile-app ecosystem, projects that users of Alphabet Inc. s GOOGL, -0.05% GOOG, +0.01% Android operating system will spend $41 billion in total on apps and subscriptions in 2017, topping $40 billion for Apple. AAPL, -0.14% The company s market forecast report said that Apple s App Store racked up $34 billion in sales in 2016, while Android apps collected $27 billion.

Apple will still have the most dominant single app store, however. While Alphabet s Google has its own Google Play online destination for apps, there are several third-party offerings for devices that run on the Android operating system. For instance, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.36% devices like the Kindle tablet run on a modified version of Android, and Amazon has its own app store for those devices. App Annie projects that revenues for Google Play and third-party Android offerings will be roughly similar, with $21 billion in Google Play revenues and $20 billion for other offerings.

Danielle Levitas, senior vice president of research for App Annie, pointed out that Android should be expected to outpace Apple, since Android devices outnumber iOS devices by about a 5-to-1 ratio worldwide.

 So there s much room for movement and while this shift might happen in 2017, ultimately, we forecast the App Store remaining the most lucrative store in the next five years,  Levitas said in an email.

The splintered nature of the Android app ecosystem and monolithic approach for Apple mirror the larger smartphone market, where Android phones and tablets outsell iPhones and iPads, but Apple reaps greater rewards from its sales. According to Gartner Inc., Android had more than 80% of the smartphone market share in 2016 while iOS was at 17.7%, yet Apple routinely takes a majority of global profits in selling its devices.

Don t miss: Why Alphabet could be more valuable than Apple

Apple takes in much more revenue per user and per app downloaded, according to App Annie, which reported that Apple users downloaded 29 billion apps in 2016 against 118 billion total Android app downloads. That split is expected to grow this year, when the report projects 30 billion downloads from Apple s App Store and 165 billion combined Android app downloads, and continue into the future. In 2021, App Annie projects that Apple will have 42 billion app downloads while Android will have 308 billion combined. While Android is projected to still have the revenue lead in 2021, the split is nowhere near as large as in downloads, with Android projected to collect $78 billion to Apple s $60 billion.

 iOS will remain the most lucrative app store through 2021, generating $60.3 billion, thanks to growing revenue per device from Apple s comparatively affluent customer base,  the report states.  However, the combination of Google Play and third-party Android is forecast to exceed iOS in 2017 as the sharp growth in installed base of Android devices makes up for lower user purchasing power. 

Why the bank of the future will look like an Apple store (1:31) As e-banking technology has improved, the number of bank branches is expected to fall by a third in the next decade. But rather than get rid of branches altogether, banks are trying to give them makeovers to get customers to still come in.

Apple has highlighted its software and services growth in the past year, as iPhone sales have struggled to increase. While App Store revenue is not disclosed individually, executives said in a January conference call that the App Store had its strongest month ever in December, with sales topping $3 billion, and revenue grew 43% in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Google also wants to make Google Play a bigger part of its offerings, bringing the app store to its Chromebook line of low-price laptops as well as its virtual-reality platform, Daydream.

Apple stock has been hot of late, and hit another record closing high Wednesday after establishing its fifth record close of the month Tuesday. Apple shares have gained about 24% in the past three months and 34% in the past year, while Google s class A shares have increased 5.8% and 10.9% in those periods. The S&P 500 index SPX, +0.07% has increased 5% in the past three months and 14.9% in the past year.

The biggest driver of app revenue is video games, App Annie reported. Games accounted for slightly less than 40% of total downloads across platforms, but more than 81% of revenue, which does not include advertising revenue that gaming companies collect outside the app ecosystem. Apple Inc. (AAPL) iPhone 8 Production Forecast Positive but Caution Still ... Will the strength of Apple Inc. s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 8 cycle be enough to pull past other rising market risks and can Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) stand the fire as Facebook attempts to steal the company s freshest, hippest moves? One analyst boosts the price target on Apple underscoring advantageous iPhone 8 production estimates, but maintains caution overall in face of an over-saturated smartphone market. Meanwhile, for investors who interpret Facebook s onslaught of  masks, frames and interactive filters  as a reason to get skittish, another analyst says the very reason Facebook is bringing its sharpest parroting game proves Snap is a true force of reckoning. Let s take a closer look:

Apple s Double-Sided Coin: iPhone 8 Production vs. Smartphone Market Risk

Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang is weighing in on Apple staunchly from the sidelines, encouraged by  aggressive  iPhone 8 production expectations set for 100 to 110 million units by the back half of the year, but cautious amid whirling rivalry and anticipated waning near-term iPhone demand. On back of robust production projections for the iPhone 8, the analyst reiterates a Neutral rating on shares of AAPL while lifting the price target to $120, which represents a close to 17% downside from where the stock is currently trading.

On a confident note, Zhang asserts,  In our view, the iPhone 8 OLED model will have a better cycle than the iPhone 7, and recent positive sentiment already reflects iPhone 8 optimism. 

However,  Slowing demand in China and increasing competition from Samsung (005930-KR:NR) this year might limit iPhone 8 sales growth. Further hardware upgrades might not be able speed up the overall smartphone upgrade cycle,  continues the analyst, who likewise points to  concerns over the saturation of the smartphone market  coupled with  gross margin pressure with increasing component costs  as underlying fears circling the tech giant.

 Recently, we believe Apple has reduced their June quarter production forecast by 8-10%. Even with the launch of the iPhone 7 Red model, we expect overall iPhone demand to slow down in the near term. Retail data suggests that iPhone 7 sales have sequentially declined in February and March. In our view, Samsung s S8 launch might not affect short-term iPhone sales. Currently, suppliers are preparing capacity for the iPhone 8 production ramp in 2H17; therefore, we think the market has overlooked Q2 risk,  Zhang surmises.

As usual, we recommend taking analyst notes with a grain of salt. According to TipRanks, Jun Zhang is ranked #4,118 out of 4,556 analysts. Zhang has a 41% success rate and faces a loss of 10.5% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, Zhang forfeits 8.1% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics show AAPL as a Buy. Out of 37 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 29 are bullish on Apple stock, 6 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of 6%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $153.07.

Facebook Copying Snap Features Is Not a Bad Sign

Snap shares were falling almost 7% yesterday after its archrival Facebook came out like a lion with an in-app camera release complete with filters that are the rival s next double cross punch in the social media boxing ring to take out Snap.

Though some Snap shareholders are taken aback, fearful that Facebook has the cunning power to knock Snap out of the water, to Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White,  imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.  White argues that Facebook s competitive cloning of the popular Snapchat app parent company s Lenses and Geofilters is the very reason to back the stock, as it s essentially Mark Zuckerberg s validation that Snap poses a real, leading-edge threat.

Therefore, despite the pullback yesterday, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on SNAP with a price target of $30, which represents a 35% increase from where the shares last closed.

White notes,  Just last week, we noticed a healthy uptick in Sponsored Lenses from Snap. Although Snap is the innovator in Lenses and Geofilters, it is not surprising to see Facebook copy the company as South Korea-based Snow has already done. 

 After a strong performance over the past week and Facebook s announcement around new  Snap-like  features this morning, the stock is taking a breather,  adds the analyst, who advises to use yesterday s  weakness as a buying opportunity. 

Ultimately,  In our view, Facebook announcements are a strong endorsement of Snap s innovative products and creative vision. As such, we are not surprised to see another platform copy Snap; however, we believe Snap has a cachet with the millennial crowd that will be difficult for other platforms to garner. Like Apple in its younger days, we view Snap as a disruptive innovator with a laser like focus,  White concludes.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, five-star analyst Brian White is ranked #145 out of 4,556 analysts. White has a 65% success rate and earns 10.2% in his yearly returns. When recommending SNAP, White gains 8.9% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate SNAP as a Hold. Based on 32 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 12 rate a Buy on Snap stock, 13 maintain a Hold, while 7 issue a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $23.48, marking a nearly 6% upside from where the stock is currently trading. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Surged To A New High On UBS Comments Apple Inc. (AAPL) traded to the upside until around mid-afternoon Tuesday, before settling into a range. The stock ended the day with a gain of 2.92 at $143.80. Apple broke out of a 1-month trading range and set a new high for the year.

An analysts at UBS stated Tuesday that Apple's stock price could climb to $200 per share in the next two to three years.

Apple, Inc. Is About to Expand US Manufacturing, but It's Not What You Think Too bad we're not talking about iPhone manufacturing. Image source: Apple.

Continue Reading Below

Expanding domestic manufacturing is the popularthing to do right about now, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office in just 10 days. We've already seen a handful of domestic companies cave to the political pressure, altering investment plans to focus on U.S. facilities in some cases. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has also been dragged into the debate, for better or for worse. Well, the Mac maker is now reportedly looking to expand its operations in Mesa, Arizona, and begin "high-tech manufacturing," according to government documents first noticed by Business Insider yesterday.

Apple is looking to assemble data center cabinets at the facility, and they would be destined for use in Apple's other data center facilities around the world. The company currently assembles data center gear at each respective site, but this move would consolidate the assembling in Mesa. Finished equipment will be shipped to other Apple data centers within the U.S., according to the report.

Might as well use it

This is really about Apple continuing to repurpose its Mesa, Arizona, facility, which you may recall was initially built to be a massive manufacturing site for sapphire glass back when the iPhone maker had partnered with GT Advanced Technology, which went bankrupt in late 2014 as a way to extricate itself from the ill-fated supplier relationship. Apple had built the facility and was to rent it out to GT Advanced, and the surprise bankruptcy announcement left Apple with 1.2 million square foot of space to repurpose.

In early 2015, Apple said it would invest $2 billion in the facility to convert it to a green data center that would serve as a sort of control center for the company's four other domestic data centers. The Mesa, Arizona, facility would also focus on storing iCloud and iTunes data. For the past few years, Apple has been quietly designing its own servers and other back-end infrastructure, in part to improve security.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

As far as jobs go, Apple will initially add approximately 150 "high-paid" jobs at the facility, according to the report. That's good news for the local economy, but ultimately a drop in the bucket. It's also not as if Apple is expanding the operations for political purposes. The move is more about utilizing a facility that Apple had already bought and paid for.

It looks like Trump will just have to keep on fighting for domestic manufacturing jobs, since this isn't quite what he's looking for.

Continues to Slip in China Local Chinese manufacturers continue to chip away at iOS. Image source: Apple.

Continue Reading Below

You win some, you lose some.

Kantar has released its most recent estimates on numerous smartphone markets around the world, covering the three months ending November 2016 before the holiday shopping season picked up steam. Well, the news is mixed. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was able to chip away at Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) lead in key geographies in Europe as well as the U.S., but continued to slip in greater China, where local manufacturers are flooding the market with low-cost Android devices.

Let's dig through the numbers.

The good

The iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, and iPhone 6s were the top three handsets within the U.S. for the period, grabbing a combined 31% market share. Samsung's Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge came in at the No. 4 and No. 5 spots and accounted for 29% of sales. Aggressive carrier promotions helped both the Mac maker and the South Korean conglomerate, as all the domestic carriers had various promotions to get a free flagship devices. Overall, iOS grew within the U.S. by 6.4 percentage points to grab a 43.5% market share.

Interestingly, Google's decision to partner with Verizon as the exclusive carrier distributing the Pixel seems to be paying off, with the Pixel comprising about 1.3% of all smartphone sales; over half of those new phones were activated at Big Red. That may not sound like a whole lot, but it's actually impressive when you consider that Nexus and Pixel phones have never been high-volume devices, so 1.3% is actually pretty good within that context.

In Europe, Apple did particularly well within the U.K., where it saw its market share jump 9.1 percentage points, and now has a 48.3% share in the country. iOS also jumped by 6.5 percentage points in France to a 24.5% market share. In the broader EU5 (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the U.K.), Apple had 24.6% share of all smartphone sales.

The bad

Apple has seen its position in China deteriorate over the past year or so, while local players have been able to rise and chip away at both Apple and larger Android original equipment manufacturers. Android now accounts for 80% of smartphones sold in the Middle Kingdom, which is the largest smartphone market in the world. iOS fell from 25.3% of urban China to just 19.9%, although Apple was up modestly on a sequential basis. The only silver lining here is that the iPhone 7 was the single best-selling device in urban China, grabbing 6.6% of all sales.

The problem is that there are so many other low-cost Android choices out there that make up the rest of the market (Huawei and Oppo now represent nearly 40% of the market). Apple's business in China is still on a long-term upward trajectory and I have little doubt that the company will recover, but it's definitely seen better days.

Tesla Just Hired the Creator of Apple, Inc.'s Swift Programming Language Electric-car maker Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced on Tuesday that it just snapped up Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) director of developer tools, Chris Lattner. The executive was integral at Apple, responsible for creating Swift, a new programming language the tech giant announced in 2014. The important hire comes at a critical time for Tesla as it works to advance the software behind its next-generation driver-assist sensor system for Autopilot.

From Swift to Autopilot

Lattner's decision to leave Apple and join Tesla "wasn't taken lightly," according to a statement Lattner posted on Swift.org to explain the move. Indeed, Lattner said he won't be entirely leaving the Swift community. "I plan to remain an active member of the Swift Core Team, as well as a contributor to the swift-evolution mailing list," he said.

But make no mistake. Lattner is definitely leaving Apple and joining Tesla. In fact, he confirmed in his post that he will be leaving Apple later this month.

At Tesla, Lattner will take on the title of vice president of Autopilot software. Lattner will take over for Jinnah Hosein, SpaceX's vice president of software, who was "serving a dual role as the interim Vice President of Tesla Software and will now be heading back to SpaceX full-time," Tesla said in a blog post on Tuesday. "We are very excited that Chris is joining Tesla to lead our Autopilot engineering team and accelerate the future of autonomous driving," Tesla said.

To fill Lattner's role with the Swift programming language, Apple's Ted Kremenek, who is currently the senior manager of languages and runtimes at Apple, will now lead the day-to-day operations of the Swift Core Team.

Furthermore, just as Lattner is stepping up to lead Tesla's Autopilot team, Tesla's director of Autopilot programs, Sterling Anderson, is leaving the company. Interestingly, shortly after the news broke, Anderson mysteriously tweeted, "You ain't seen nothing yet..."

Taking Autopilot to the next level

Lattner joins Tesla's Autopilot team at a crucial period for the technology's development, only a few months after the company made the surprising announcement that it started including full self-driving hardware in every vehicle it ships.

The new hardware included in Tesla vehicles includes eight surround cameras for 360-degree visibility for up to 250 meters of range, 12 improved ultrasonic sensors, forward-facing radar, and a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of its predecessor.

The sudden inclusion of the new hardware in every vehicle Tesla produces has presented challenges for the company, which, according to a tweet from CEO Elon Musk in December, have the Autopilot team working seven days a week.

First, vehicles with the new hardware temporarily lack Autopilot features included in vehicles with the older hardware as the company validates the software using customer data generated from operating the new Autopilot sensors in shadow mode as Tesla owners go about their normal day-to-day driving. While the company has started releasing updates to a portion of its vehicles delivered with the new hardware, Musk recently said he hopes the company will be ready this weekend to finally release an update to bring all new-hardware vehicles to feature parity with older vehicles.

Second, the new Autopilot sensors presented manufacturing problems during the company's fourth quarter, as Tesla blamed "short-term production challenges" related to its transition to the new sensors for its worse-than-expected deliveries for the quarter.

Autopilot's ongoing development is an important piece of Tesla's business as it aggressively pursues autonomous vehicles. Apple: The Trend Is Your Friend According to AJ Dellinger of International Business Times, "now may be a good time to ditch your shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)." The rationale for this argument was that several fund managers were going underweight Apple's stock heading into the new year, and investors should do the same. I could not disagree more with this philosophy and would be more inclined to do the opposite of what the author recommended. When fund managers are less optimistic and trimming a stock that is breaking out on its weekly chart, I would rather be accumulating. Apple closed at a new 52-week high today, and there is absolutely nothing bearish about its technicals. The stock is still in buy-mode based on the 40-week moving average strategy I've outlined in past articles, and looks primed to reach my $140.00 target at some point this year.

Apple was a fan favorite for years among investors, but the stock's sluggish performance since 2012 has created a sleuth of bears who were skeptical of the stock. My last article was met with predominantly bullish comments, but several bears didn't hesitate to poke their head out and share their views. While many are focused on the fundamentals of Apple which are under scrutiny by thousands of people daily, I prefer to rely on the technicals. I have been trading Apple the past eight years using a 40-week moving average system, and it has significantly outperformed a buy and hold approach over the past 20 years.

(Source: TC2000.com)

The system is very simple and requires less than five minutes of work each week. I do not need to watch Apple's share price during the day, and I could care less where the stock closes between Monday and Thursday. All that matters to me is the Friday closing price. The goal of the system is to be long only when Apple has momentum behind its back. To avoid whipsaws and intraday trading noise, I find a weekly chart does the best job of filtering out short term fluctuations in the share price.

So how does the system work?

Entries: The system waits for AAPL to make a weekly close back above its 40-week moving average, and then goes long on the opening of the next week.

Exits: The system exits long positions if Apple makes a weekly close below its 40-week moving average.

The below chart illustrates what this system looks like over the past few years trading Apple:

(Source: TC2000.com)

The green arrows in the above chart are entries to long positions, and the red arrows on the chart show the exits. As you can see from the chart, Apple's relationship with its 40-week moving average gives clues to future performance. If Apple is above its 40-week moving average, you will likely do very well long the stock. If Apple is below its 40-week moving average, it would make most sense to sit in cash until it regains this level.

How do I know the system has outperformed a simple buy & hold approach over the past 20 years? The results are as follows:

(Source: Author's Table)

As we can see from the above table, this system has required very little work, but has outperformed a buy and hold approach by a wide margin. The system has had 16 closed trades in the past 18 years, which is equivalent to less than 1 trade per year. In terms of outperformance, there is a drastic difference. An investor that bought Apple with a starting account of $10,000 would have an investment worth just over $1.8 million if he was still holding today. Conversely, an investor who traded Apple using the above system would have a significantly higher return from inception, with an account worth $3.19 million (3,190% return vs 1,800% return).

(Source: TC2000.com)

So how am I positioning myself?

The most recent signal for Apple came on July 29th of last year, when the stock closed back above its 40-week moving average. This triggered a new long entry on the first day of the next trading week, and I went long Apple at $104.44 on August 1st. Thus far, I am up over 14% on my trade, and my stop currently sits below $106.54 on a weekly close.

Taking a look at the technicals for Apple, the bears really have no business betting against the stock here. Apple has broken out of a weekly downtrend, and has been making higher highs and higher lows for the past nine months. I posted the below chart in my most recent article for Apple with the following excerpt:

As we can see in the above chart, the bear market for Apple is clearly over. The stock has had a weekly uptrend in place since May and is currently forming a base above its previous resistance at $110.00. While Apple has not seen significant price appreciation yet, this does not invalidate the fact that it's begun a new uptrend. Often new bull markets spend a while shaking out all of the weak hands before they eventually take off. I believe we should see a higher high early next year, and expect we will finally see a $120 handle back on Apple.

(Source: TC2000.com)

Thus far, my analysis has been correct, as the stock has made yet another higher high near the $120.00 level. Based on the average winning trade for this system, Apple would move to over $200.00 a share before the next exit is triggered. I am not this optimistic on the stock, but I am standing by my $140.00 price target for 2017. The only way I would change my thesis on Apple is if the stock closes below $106.54 on a weekly basis. We can see in the below chart that Apple's 40-week moving average is beginning slope upwards, which is typically a good sign for a stock. Ideally bulls want to see Apple continue to base above $115.00/share, so the 40-week moving average can assume a slightly more positive slope going into the second quarter.

(Source: TC2000.com)

Apple broke out to a new 52-week high today and is now above its minor resistance from its October highs. This is a very positive development for the stock, as it's recorded a new Turtle buy signal as of today. If Apple sees any corrections going forward, I expect the uptrend line to provide support. The uptrend line currently comes in at $110, and this would allow the stock to make a slightly higher low above its December lows. Personally, the next 5-10% move on Apple to be to the upside as momentum is now at its back on a daily and weekly basis.

(Source: TC2000.com)

Apple remains one of my favorite stocks going into 2017 and is fairly priced compared to historical valuations. Its P/E ratio (TTM) of 14.37 is well below its five-year average, and it currently pays a very respectable yield for a tech company. While those looking for high-growth stocks may see better options elsewhere, the stock is certainly attractive from a value point of view. I see zero reason to doubt the stock going forward, and believe the base it has built over the past year could be a launch pad for the current breakout. The bear market in Apple ended in 2016, and the bears would be better served to go into hibernation while they still can.

Apple Inc. Supplier Readying for Ramp-Up of New 10-Nanometer Tech Contract-chip manufacturing giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) recently announced its earnings results, provided forward guidance for the current quarter, and provided a lot of insight on the ramp-up of its next-generation chip-manufacturing technology, called 10-nanometers (10nm for short).

TSMC's new 10nm technology is expected to bring performance, power, and area benefits compared to its current generation 16nm technology. Those improvements should allow its customers -- with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) being a big one -- to develop chips with better performance and more features than what they could create with older-generation technologies.

On TSMC's most recent earnings call, company executives provided some key business and financial insight around its upcoming 10nm technology.

The big bang comes in the second half of 2017

TSMC has previously said that it expects to begin production shipments of its 10nm technology in the first quarter of 2017. On the call, TSMC Chairman Morris Chang explained that, although production of 10nm chips will "start to ramp in the first quarter [of 2017]," shipments will "ramp-up very strongly in the second half.

TSMC's Lora Ho later said that revenue from 10nm wafers will exceed 10% of the company's quarterly revenue in the third quarter of the year. For the full year, she said, TSMC's revenue from 10nm wafers will make up more than 10% of the company's yearly revenues -- implying that 10nm shipments during the fourth quarter of the year will make up much more than 10% of revenue.

Several mobile-processor makers are expected to use TSMC's 10nm technology in the second half of 2017, including MediaTek (a low-cost mobile chipmaker that aspires to gain traction in the high end of the market), HiSilicon (Huawei's chip-development arm), and of course, Apple.

Apple is likely to be far and away the largest customer of TSMC 10nm wafers. Apple's iPhone volume is likely to shift very quickly to the next-generation models powered by 10nm chips, and Apple's iPhone is the highest-volume premium smartphone in the market.

The revenue-ramp profile that TSMC is talking about here -- small volumes in the first half of 2017; large volumes in the second half of 2017 -- is consistent with Apple's established iPhone-release schedule.

Great market-share expectations

Chang offered some commentary around his market-share expectations for its 10nm technology. He said that, a year-ago, he "vowed then that every new [manufacturing] node from now on will have a market share higher than our market share on 16 [nm]."

Chang didn't give a specific market share figure for the company's 16nm technology, but estimated it at between 65% and 70%. He then told analyst Mehdi Hosseini that TSMC is confident that the company's share of the 10nm market would "very definitely" be above 65%."

Gross margin impact of 10nm transition

Ahead of new manufacturing-technology introductions, TSMC generally tells investors that, as those new technologies ramp-up, they'll dilute the company's consolidated gross profit margins for quite a few quarters.

The transition to 10nm will be no different. Chang told investors that the company expects the ramp-up of its 10nm technology to negatively impact the company's gross profit margins by 2% during the second half of the year.

Apple Buys Powerful Automation App Workflow Automation is an important requirement with the growing number of apps and notifications, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) knows it. That is why it has acquired the popular automation app Workflow, according to TechCrunch.

What Does Workflow Do?

Source: Shutterstock

Like the IFTTT service, the Workflow app allows users to perform several complicated tasks with a single tap by enabling them to group together a large number of actions, notes TechCrunch.

Workflow came into existence in 2014. Since then, it has made several tasks easy such as creating GIFs from a series of photos, posting photos on several social platforms at once, translations of texts and lot more. To use an automation task, a user needs to go to the app s built-in gallery, which offers them numerous options, including custom automation.

In 2015, the app received AAPL s design award at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. The iPhone maker told TechCrunch that it chose the app for the award because it used iOS accessibility features in a commendable manner.

The app did tremendous work when it comes to implementing VoiceOver with clearly labeled items, thoughtful hints, and drag/drop announcements. This made the app usable and easily accessible.

How Could Workflow Help Apple?

The Workflow acquisition also brings to Apple the team behind it, which includes Ari Weinstein, Nick Frey, Conrad Kramer and Ayaka Nonaka. The app will become available for free on the App Store (it was a paid app earlier).

Expressing his excitement about joining Apple, Weinstein stated,  We ve worked closely with Apple from the very beginning, from kickstarting our company as students attending WWDC to developing and launching Workflow and seeing its amazing success on the App Store. We can t wait to take our work to the next level at Apple and contribute to products that touch people across the world. 

No more details about the deal are known for now. It is not known how Apple s offerings will be integrated with the app. It may be that its capabilities will be integrated into iOS in the future. According to TechCruch, Siri could benefit immensely from Workflow s capabilities.

The Workflow acquisition could also help in one more way. AAPL automation guru Sal Saghoian recently quit. Since then, many have been wondering whether the company will abandon its automation features, but now with Workflow s team, it may continue them.

Apple Inc. gears up to distribute $3.1 billion in dividends to shareholders On February 16, Apple will pay shareholders of record a quarterly dividend of $0.57 per share, but investors must own the company's stock before February 9 in order to qualify. Apple will pay out $3.1 billion in dividends on its outstanding shares for the quarter.

Apple has been paying its shareholders a dividend about a month and a half after the end of each fiscal quarter ever since it declared its modern dividend plan in the summer of 2012.The February dividend will be the eleventh to occur since the company issued a 7-for-1 stock split . That split also converted the dividend from $3.29 per share to 47 cents per share, which Apple subsequently increased last year to 52 cents.February's dividend will be the fourth 57 cent dividend Apple has paid since it announced plans to increase its dividend from 52 cents during its Q2 2016 earnings conference call.Over the past four quarters, Apple has paid out around $12 billion in dividends to its shareholders, distributing close to $3 billion every quarter, although that number has decreased slightly in tandem with the company's stock buybacks.Dividends are a minority portion of Apple's shareholder capital return program, the majority of which has been earmarked for buying back outstanding shares.Buybacks increase the scarcity, and therefore value, of Apple's stock by taking shares off the market and retiring them. Removing shares from circulation also enhances the company's closely-watched earnings per share metrics. Over the last four quarters, Apple has repurchased $34 billion worth of its stock off the market or via accelerated repurchase programs, with $11 billion of that spent in the most recent quarter ending in December.In total, Apple has spent $144 billion on stock buybacks since initiating its capital return program, including an opportunistic $14 billion share grab initiated after the stock plunged more than 8 percent in January 2015 following the company's holiday Q1 release which detailed its highest ever quarterly revenues and operating profits--results that the tech media depicted as " disappointing ."This happened again in the summer after Apple announced record earnings in June but market players raised the fearsome prospect of weak sales in China. Apple's shares tanked, enabling the company to opportunistically snatch up $14 billion of its own shares at what was then the lowest point in 2015.Apple subsequently announced blockbuster earnings for the holiday Q4, particularly in China where revenue nearly doubled and iPhone sales grew by 87 percent in a market that only grew by 4 percent (meaning that outside of Apple, the market for smartphones had actually contracted). Apple also guided for growth higher than analysts were expecting. That correction in intelligence sent Apple's stock up a relatively meager few percent, followed by a massive collapse resulting from new rumors of supplier cuts that were interpreted as representing a massive decline in iPhone demand.However, those rumors did not materialize in Q1 results. Instead, Apple provided guidance for Q2 to indicate a much smaller decline year over year than the rumors had anticipated. Even so, Apple's shares have continued to fall to levels not seen since the summer of 2014, before iPhone 6--the most popular and massively successful computing device ever sold--appeared.Against earlier predictions, iPhone 6s achieved similar sales in the winter quarter, while Apple's valuation returned to the days of iPhone 5/5s. Over the March quarter, Apple's global sales of iPhones, iPad and Macs were all lower than the year ago quarter, with the company attributed to a difficult economic climate and very unfavorable exchange rates across most of its international regions.Combined with dividend payments and net share settlements, Apple has spent $250 billion on capital return since mid 2012.Prior to its 2014 stock split, Apple spent about $50 billion buying back shares at prices ranging from around $50 to $90. Since the stock split, Apple has repurchased shares at prices from $100 to $130 per share, at times significantly higher than the current stock price--indicating that Apple expected its stock to recover and appreciate to much higher levels.Apple's shares have indeed since spiraled upward, and are currently trading above $130.The company's post-split buybacks included a surprising $17 billion of its own stock in the September 2014 quarter; $5 billion of stock in open market purchases during its December 2014 quarter (Apple's Fiscal Q1 2015); another $7 billion of stock in open market purchases during its March quarter (Apple's Fiscal Q2 2015); another $4 billion of stock in open market purchases and $6 billion in Accelerated Share Repurchase in the June quarter (Apple's Fiscal Q3 2015); followed by an astounding $14 billion of stock in open market purchases in the September quarter (Apple's Fiscal Q4 2015) and $11 billion in the most recent December quarter.As of January 20, 2017, the company has 5.247 billion shares outstanding Apple is currently using much of its domestic U.S. cash flow to finance stock buybacks and dividend payments, and is also issuing bonds at extremely low interest rates to help pay for its capital return programs.It currently holds $230 billion of its total $246 billion in cash reserves overseas; spending those funds domestically would incur a substantial tax penalty unless the U.S. Congress approves a tax break to enable and incentivize American firms to invest their foreign earnings in America.Investors generally view cash as bad for companies to hoard (due to low returns from conservative investments), but Apple can't currently distribute more cash to shareholders without incurring a substantial U.S. tax penalty.That has made Apple's vast cash holdings a convenient problem to have, because it enables the company to borrow at interest rates very close to zero for domestic investment and capital returns to shareholders while still maintaining vast market power to make long term component deals and strategic investments ranging from acquisitions to expansions of its retail network and its production capabilities.Apple currently holds $88 billion in total debt, including $10.5 billion in Commercial Paper outstanding.Last year Apple reported that it expected to invest $15 billion in infrastructure, tooling, retail and other capital expenditures in fiscal 2016. For the current year, Apple expects to spend $16 billion.Last May, Apple announced a $1 billion investment in Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing, a move that resulted in rival Uber ending its efforts to compete in China. The company also continues to expand its retail presence in China, in tandem with plans to expand its research and development center in Shanghai.Apple has also initiated efforts to expand into India, including a technology center in Hyderabad (above) and a Design and Development Accelerator in Bengaluru.The company is also expanding two offices in Israel focused on advanced silicon chip design and memory technology, as well as its corporate office and R&D center in Cambridge, England, focused on Siri voice recognition and natural language parsing intelligence Apple Inc. (AAPL) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for February 09, 2017 Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) will begin trading ex-dividend on February 09, 2017. A cash dividend payment of $0.57 per share is scheduled to be paid on February 16, 2017. Shareholders who purchased AAPL prior to the ex-dividend date are eligible for the cash dividend payment. This marks the 4th quarter that AAPL has paid the same dividend.

The previous trading day's last sale of AAPL was $131.53, representing a -0.42% decrease from the 52 week high of $132.09 and a 47.01% increase over the 52 week low of $89.47.

AAPL is a part of the Technology sector, which includes companies such as International Business Machines Corporation ( IBM ) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ( HPE ). AAPL's current earnings per share, an indicator of a company's profitability, is $8.35. Zacks Investment Research reports AAPL's forecasted earnings growth in 2017 as 7.64%, compared to an industry average of 10.6%.

Warren Buffett Loves Apple, Can The Stock Hit $150? Last week's earnings call from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) must have brought a sly smile to the face of Warren Buffett and all shareholders long the stock.

The company reported the perfect Goldilocks quarter that seemed like a fairy tale. Here are a few takeaways from the earnings report.

All time revenue record of $78.4 billion and all-time record quarterly earnings per diluted share of $3.36.

Here is a comment from CEO Tim Cook.

"We're thrilled to report that our holiday quarter results generated Apple's highest quarterly revenue ever, and broke multiple records along the way. We sold more iPhones than ever before and set all-time revenue records for iPhone, Services, Mac and Apple Watch." "Revenue from Services grew strongly over last year, led by record customer activity on the App Store, and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline."

Here is a condensed financial statement from the company's 10Q.

While the company is posting excellent profits, there is one thing missing: Growth. Apple is struggling to grow profits from last year.

Demand: When you sell every iPhone you can make and you're out of balance with supply and demand that is a good problem many companies wish they had. Apple says they are in balance as of January.

Share repurchases: The share count dropped from 5.59B to 5.327B. Investors can appreciate the allocation of capital, buying at a much lower level than the stock is trading at today. However the 266,132 shares that were bought actually skew the earnings to the upside.

$27B in operating cash flow is a testament to the power of the brand.

Perhaps the Trump plan to repatriate dollars overseas could be the opportunity for Apple to use their overseas cash hoard to open some massive manufacturing plant in the US.

Warren Buffett likes a business model that he can understand, last October I wrote an article suggesting a rally to the $150 level. I don't think Mr. Buffett is selling any of his shares here although we will have to wait to see quarterly filings. My belief is that he understands Apple and sees it like a commodity business with high demand.

What happened to the bears?

Back in the summer Apple was under attack with analysts calling for lower iPhone sales and plummeting revenue. Fast forward six months and the stock has gone on a $43 rally.

Is it time to take profits? A look at the Charts.

While I like the company's record sales it might be time to consider taking profits and reentering on a pullback at the 50 day moving average. As you can see from the chart, stocks don't go up in a straight line.

I am going neutral on Apple, I still think it is possible to hit $150 if this breakout holds, however I usually have to sell these gap ups before the market takes the gains.

Positive catalyst going forward?

I am not sure what will be the next event that will take Apple higher although I am sure they are working on many fronts.

The app store did $3B in purchases in December alone according to CEO Tim Cook. Services had a banner quarter raking in $7.6B in revenue. The company is hitting on all cylinders at the moment and the street likes what they see.

I see a combination of market execution on all fronts keeping revenue somewhat stable but investors will have to wait and see what the next new product will be to drive meaningful growth.

Conclusion

Apple is on fire right now, however their revenue is not growing significantly yoy. Their business model continues to execute and everything is looking good for the company. Apple is still priced relatively reasonable compared to many other companies and they continue to deliver products that the public loves.

The stock looks a little overextended here to my eye, I am not saying to sell it but a pullback seems likely at some point in the future. In hindsight it is quite clear that the time to buy was last year in June in the low $90s. Congratulations to those that bought that last sell off and held to present.

As always do your own research and always know your exit point before making any trade.

Every time Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) launches a new product, the product is put under intense scrutiny to figure out if it can replicate the monumental success of the iPhone. I do not like this comparison, but for those who do, even though Apple Watch will not mirror the success of the iPhone, it can easily prove to be a resounding success for the company in the next 3-5 years.

(Source: Apple)

While discussing the performance of Apple Watch in Q1, CEO Tim Cook said:

It was also our best quarter ever for Apple Watch, both units and revenues, with holiday demand so strong that we couldn't make enough. Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch in the world and also the most loved, with the highest customer satisfaction in its category by a wide margin. Apple Watch is the ultimate device for a healthy life, and it is the gold standard for smartwatches. We couldn't be more excited about Apple Watch.



With Siri and a new Home app in iOS 10, everywhere you go, you can easily and securely control all of your home accessories with your iPhone, iPad, or your Apple Watch.

This clearly indicates that management does not believe the Apple Watch has to be the next iPhone, or any other product for that matter. The company's strategy is to bring new products into its highly connected ecosystem, where several products are intelligently linked to serve multiple purposes.

Regarding estimating the growth of Apple Watch sales, analysts only have third-party estimates to go with, since the company does not release unit sales for the smartwatch. Apple Watch revenue is included in the company's Other Products segment.

(Source: Apple 8-K)

From the latest 8-K, it can be seen that Other Products revenue had registered a positive change of 70 percent sequentially and a decline of 8 percent year on year. For Q1 2017, Other Products revenue stood at $4,024 million.

Note: Other Products includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats Products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.

Last week, Strategy Analytics released a report in which it estimated Apple to have sold a record 5.2 million smartwatches worldwide in Q4 2016 and captured a leading 63 percent market share, a rise of 2 percent annually from 5.1 million units in Q4 2015.

Cliff Raskind, Director at Strategy Analytics, said:

"Demand for Apple's new Watch Series 2 as a holiday-season gift in Western markets was surprisingly strong and it enabled Apple to clear a large backlog of smartwatch inventory during the quarter."

From an extremely conservative point of view, even if we assume that a majority of 5.2 million smartwatches sold were from Apple Watch Series 1 and consider the lowest price of $269 for the Series 1 model, Apple received $1.4 billion in Q4 sales. This is already more than one-third of the company's Other Products revenues. It also tells us that the other components (Apple TV?) in this segment are not performing so well.

There are several reasons why I encourage practicing conservatism in this case.

Although the demand for Watch Series 2 was strong in the holiday season, we do not know whether the sales were majorly of the new smartwatches or the refurbished ones. A refurbished Apple Watch Series 2, 38 mm Rose Gold Aluminum Case with Pink Sand Sport Band is available for $309 - $60 less than for the new one. The demand is also boosted by the discounts and deals at Target (NYSE:TGT), where a buyer can get a Series 1 for less than $200.

Secondly, these sales occurred during the holiday season, and Apple had an extra week this quarter. It would be prudent to adopt a "wait and watch" approach to see if the trend can be sustained in the next couple of quarters as well. Because if it does, then it would be a strong, undeniable signal that Apple Watch can be a huge success. In Q4 2016, the company's Other Products segment recorded total revenue of $2.37 billion. If Apple Watch can gather the same traction in future quarters, it would provide a helpful pump to the company's sales numbers.

Apple Watch's Revenue Contribution Can Double By 2022

I conservatively estimated Apple Watch revenue at $1.4 billion. However, there is very encouraging news for investors. This product can see twice the sales in the next five years.

In mid-2016, Strategy Analytics estimated:

"By 2022, Strategy Analytics forecasts total wholesale wearable devices revenues will top US$45 billion, driven primarily by smartwatches that will be aided by the major operating systems and their sponsors. Despite declining smartwatch prices and the growing impact of smartglasses offering more understated designs by 2022, analysts predict smartwatches will still command more than a 50 percent share of both wearables volume and value."

Going by this prediction, smartwatches should command revenue of at least $22.5 billion. Apple has been maintaining a market share of over 50 percent since it entered the scene, and there is a high probability that the lead can be maintained in the coming years as well. This means Apple Watch can bring in annual revenues of more than $11 billion (= 50 percent of $22.5 billion) by 2022. Analyst group Juniper is also estimating Apple Watch revenues of $10 billion over the next five years.

The $11 billion figure is not at all shabby given that iPad's revenue for Q1 2017 stood at $5.5 billion, and its revenue contribution has been declining for some years now. In 2014, iPad revenue stood at $30.28 billion, but deteriorated by 23 percent to $23.23 billion in 2015. 2016 also failed to provide any relief, since the revenue declined by another 11 percent to $20.63 billion.

So in the next five years, Apple Watch can easily generate more than 50 percent of iPad's annual revenue.

I am counting on the company to bring in more exciting features and not focus solely on fitness tracking. Focusing on only fitness tracking and health monitors would be severely limiting to the growth of the smartwatch and akin to putting all the eggs in one basket. Users would eventually want more complex uses from the product apart from just notifications and health checks. Additionally, there have often been complaints about the inaccuracies of the health monitors and the activity trackers. This is to say that a lot of refinement is required in this field as well, but it is still early days, and the quality will be improved in newer models.

Since Tim Cook is trying to build Apple's IoT ecosystem, more computing power (faster processors) and better batteries should be introduced in smartwatches. Launching less expensive models without compromising on the features can substantially aid the growth of the overall smartwatch ecosystem as well as Apple Watch.

While Apple is currently far ahead of its rivals in the smartwatch market, it cannot risk being complacent. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has already seen its market share erode from 13 percent in 2015 to 11.4 percent in 2016, with several smaller players, including Garmin (NASDAQ: GRMN), Fitbit, Inc. (NYSE: FIT), and Huawei, rapidly attracting more customers. The combined market share of these small players has jumped from 21.6 percent in 2015 to 33.6 percent in 2016, with their shipments growing 57.78 percent in 2016 to 7.1 million.

And the smaller players deserve a greater pie of the market, since they are offering more bang for the buck they are taking. For example, Garmin Forerunner 235 offers a battery life of 9 days, while Apple Watch Series 2 offers a battery life of just 18 hours. Garmin Forerunner 235 has several advanced functions, including High-sensitivity Receiver, Find My Phone, VIRB Control, Virtual Pacer, V02 Max Estimate, Recovery Advisor, Race Predictor, Personal Records, Virtual Partner, Virtual Racer, Auto Pause, Auto Lap, Auto Scroll, and Advanced Workouts, Automatic Sync. On the other hand, Apple Watch Series 2 has just basic functions, such as Activity Tracking with Three Rings (Stand, Move, Exercise), Workout App (Elapsed Time, Distance, Calories, Pace and Speed, Goals, Progress Updates, Workout Summary), Strava Cycling, Runtastic Six Pack, Individual Feedback, Achievements, and Activity History.

Finally, a new Garmin Forerunner 235 is now available on Amazon for $269.95, while the refurbished one is up for $229.99. These prices are 25-30 percent lower than that of the Apple product.

So, Apple has to provide several advanced features, much better battery life, higher computing power, and needs to vastly increase its stock supply to cater to the rising demand, all while keeping the price in reach of the masses. Apple Watch Series 0 had earlier failed to ignite consumers' interests because it missed on all of these requisites. Even Series 1 failed to provide important specifications such as GPS, which the company included in the Series 2. The smaller players have already acknowledged the fact that since they are focusing on fitness-centric individuals, they must provide as many useful features as they can.

But the fitness-focused crowd will soon be covered at this rate, and the companies must look beyond this niche space. Apple has the advantage here, since it already has an ecosystem where the Apple Watch can be of immense use to the customer. It has the upper hand at branching out into several others areas apart from activity tracking and fitness.

If Apple can accomplish this in a quicker time frame and at reduced costs, then Apple Watch can surely become a huge success.

Buffett's Bite Into Apple Could Turn Out To Be Sour Investors do not want to pay more than 18X EPS for the stock.

Thesis

Value investors should be somewhat against buying into Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the near term, as the phone market is once again over-saturated. Lack of innovation at Apple will help rivals gain market share.

Where is the innovation?

Since the death of Steve Jobs in 2011, Apple has continued to produce products in the way Steve Jobs would have, or at least it tries. But it has struggled every time to innovate and inspire the way Steve Jobs once did.

Apple has an enormous brand association and recognition, and it seems to be profoundly relying on this to sell future products, what in the opinion of many don't really seem to differ too much from the last, even the relentless Apple fans seem to agree.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has taken its desktop OS to a totally new territory by including touch in Windows 10. Apple, on the other hand, has used its computing line in two distinct divisions, the tablet and the desktop. iOS for iPad, and Mac OS for the Mac. This previously went well and users were satisfied with this. However, Windows 10 has shown that these experiences do not have to be kept separate. Apple has not recognized this and has yet to provide touch into the Mac OS the same way Windows has. It did introduce some form of touch in the name of the Touch Bar, but this is small and somewhat awkward to use, and it takes a while to get the hang of.

Take a look at an Apple store, over at the MacBooks, you will see customers attempting to control the MacBook by touch; consumers now automatically touch the screen expecting touch to be built into products. Has Apple missed what consumers really want, or is it keeping in line with Steve Jobs' tradition of telling them what they want?

Steve Jobs famously once said:

"A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them."

Where has Apple's edge gone?

Apple was once the benchmark of discovery. Many companies were motivated by Apple, and those companies offered poor watered-down versions of what AAPL had achieved, and still those products didn't even come close.

Apple seems to have pursued beauty and simplification over its functionality, leading many to be shocked about the recent design changes, the infamous headphone jack being one.

However, it does suggest an alternative, in the form of the $159.00 AirPods.

Back in Sept. 2016, Aneri Pattani over at CNBC questioned audio companies about AirPods, and she wrote:

"Among the new device's flaw is that wireless functionality requires constant recharging, said Mike Culver, president of Danish audio company Libratone, which is launching Lightning compatible earbuds next month. (The AirPods last for five hours per charge and come with a portable charging case that can provide more than 24 hours of battery life.) AirPods also lack the ability to produce high-resolution audio quality, said Dunja LaRosa, director and head of mobile audio at Sony Electronics. LaRosa said the future is likely in wireless, but technology hasn't progressed enough to put the cord to rest and achieve high-resolution audio."

(Data from FonePaw).

As you can see above, its close phone rival Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has a lot more in common than years prior; it's closing in on that gap, fast.

When Peter Thiel, one of the early Facebook investors, was asked to confirm or deny that, "the age of Apple is over" he replied.

"Confirm. We know what a smartphone looks like and does. It's not the fault of Tim Cook, but it's not an area where there will be any more innovation."

Research and development

Apple is investing heavily in research and development, growing around 33% on average over the past six years. If we forward this and assume that rate of growth, by 2020, Apple could be spending $31 billion on research and development.

(Data from SEC; image by author)

Currently, on an annual basis, research and development costs are around about 4.5% of net sales, quite a large jump up from 2015, when it was just under 3.5%. That represents an extra $1.9 billion spent in 2016.

(Data from SEC; image by author).

(Data from SEC; image by author).

(Data from SEC; net sales numbers on the left, and research and development on the right).

Sales declined almost 8% in 2016 YoY while research and development costs grew by 24.5%. Looking at the numbers, you become curious about what results this money could produce in 2017, or will we see the somewhat boring, predictable Apple product line rolled out once again with all the expected tweaks.

Apple's incredible advances in innovation in the mobile phone market over the years pushed the company to report record back-to-back profit growth. Over a 13-year period, Apple was undoubtedly extremely impressive.

Currently, the book value of Apple is $25.19, and it has a price to book of 5.79 (as of writing this article).

Carl Icahn and George Soros sell, Warren Buffett buys

(Image from loff)

Billionaire investor Carl Icahn said on a call with CNBC back in 2016:

"You worry a little bit - and maybe more than a little - about China's attitude" "China's government could come in and make it very difficult for Apple to sell there ... You can do pretty much what you want there."

Icahn told CNBC that China's attitude toward Apple mostly made him exit his position.

Another billionaire and infamous global macro investor George Soros also sold his Apple stake in 2016. Soros Fund Management sold its shares in Apple during Q2. Documents reveal Soros held no Apple positions as of June 30, 2016, after owning roughly 3,100 shares, a relatively small stake for the billionaire.

Buffett surprised many by drifting from his usual take on tech and diving into Apple. The Oracle has essentially always stuck to simple blue-chip companies he knows, renowned brands such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC). He has essentially dodged most of the tech market saying:

"I know about as much about semiconductors or integrated circuits as I do of the mating habits of the chrzaszcz."

Warren Buffett has frequently said that he avoids buying in the technology sector. Throughout the Internet boom in the late '90s, Buffett did not buy into the bubble and noted that he cannot value tech stocks accordingly.

So what is the logic behind Buffett's stake in Apple?

Well, it's a rather basic and simple approach, according to CNBC:

"He explained that when he takes his great-grandkids and their friends to Dairy Queen, they all have an iPhone. That prompted him to do homework on the balance sheet, capital allocation, earnings, and decide that Apple was a good buy. He started with an idea, did the homework and realized it was a great stock. Buffett viewed Apple differently from analysts on the conference call each quarter. Those analysts cover high-growth companies like Facebook and Alphabet and tend to come to the conclusion that perhaps Apple's best days are behind it."

Buffett's method while choosing to invest in Apple appears logical, but essentially all phones now are comparable in function, and I would imagine that if the same kids at Dairy Queen that day had a Samsung, LG (OTC:LGEAF), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pixel, or any of the other big names, the answers he received would be the same as the ones for the iPhone, and those same kids would be glued to that device regardless of who made it.

In my opinion, the key reason for Nokia's collapse was due to saturation of the phone market, giving consumers the freedom to switch without the fear of regret.

There was a time when people assumed Nokia would be around forever, it was the brand everyone had, but that all changed when phones became too similar, and in my opinion, that is what we are seeing today.

I have been the owner of both an iPhone 7 and a Samsung S7, the differences are narrow, and even the interface is alike now more than ever.

Currently, the iPhone makes up 44.2% of Apple's sales.

A bearish look at the stock

(Image from GuruFocus, Apple PE ratio over five years).

Investors see value at 10X EPS for Apple as you can see above, and don't favor the stock when it is above 18X. A value investor should be aiming to pay no more than $101.50 for Apple's shares unless earnings improve. From 2017 to 2018, the Street expects 13.53% change in EPS, according to Yahoo Finance.

(Image by Yahoo Finance)

Now @ 16.66 10X 14X 18X Price $139.14 $83.5 $116.9 $150.3 EPS 8.35 8.35 8.35 8.35 PE 16.66 10.00 14.00 18.00

2017e 2018e EPS est 8.94 10.15 Price 10X 89.40 101.50 Price 14X 125.16 142.10 Price 18X 160.92 182.70

Wall Street does not expect net earnings to grow significantly in 2018. In my analysis, if you buy the stock at current prices, that's around a 28% risk.

(Image by Yahoo Finance).

Trading in such high multiples in late 2016 and into 2017 could explain why analysts have been downgrading the stock. Earnings and earnings estimates do not justify such a price.

Conclusion

Over the next product cycle, the company urgently needs to innovate and inspire once again. Earnings are not expected to be too impressive unless something big is announced.

The iPhone was once a benchmark of innovation that could not be mimicked. Unfortunately for Apple, it has presented minimal changes over the years, defending the iPhone's market share will be a hard task for Tim Cook.

Better Buy: Apple Inc. vs. IBM In its famous 1984 commercial, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) portrayed International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) as Big Brother. Once the fiercest of rivals, the two companies are far more similar than different today. Beyond their size and maturity, Apple and IBM shares have also been on a tear over the past 12 months.

Considering their many similarities, it's appropriate for investors to wonder whose shares are the more attractive potential buy today. To better answer this question, we'll put Apple and IBM stocks through a three-part analysis to gain a clearer sense of which one is the better buy now.

1. Financial fortitude

Let's cut to the chase here: Apple wins the contest of financial fortitude by a landslide. It deserves noting, though, that this is more due to Apple's historic profitability rather than any financial imprudence on IBM's part.

Company Cash and Investments Debt Cash From Operations Current Ratio Apple $237.5 billion $87.0 billion $65.8 billion 1.3 IBM $15.0 billion $42.4 billion $18.5 billion 1.2

Apple generates the bulk of its sales overseas, and its practice of keeping its cash offshore has triggered several not-so-small controversies in recent years. Apple held $216 billion of its cash overseas as of its most recent earnings report. That means Apple can't directly tap into the majority of its cash holdings without paying steep repatriation taxes. Rather, Apple borrows against its overseas cash to fund its capital return program.

Turning to IBM, Big Blue similarly has its financial house in order. Though it has leveraged its balance sheet to a certain extent, IBM generates plenty of cash flow to both service its debts and reinvest in its business. However, Apple's overall profitability simply can't be beat, making it the easy winner in this portion of our analysis.

Winner: Apple.

2. Durable competitive advantages

Turning to their competitive moats, Apple and IBM each enjoy some type of competitive advantage over their rivals. However, for both companies, their competitive advantages might not be as pronounced as they might initially seem.

Apple's platinum-grade brand, closed-loop operating system, consistent device leadership, and immense financial resources certainly all contribute to its ability to consistently generate above-average returns on capital. Some of these items should prove fairly straightforward. Apple's Fort Knox-esque cash reserves allow it to buy its way into virtually any industry that interests it. However, Apple's closed-loop software architecture receives far less attention but is arguably more important in terms of supporting Apple's competitive position.

In contrast to Alphabet's Android or Microsoft's Windows operating systems, Apple makes its software and app ecosystem available on its devices. That means users who migrate away from Apple's computers or mobile devices might not be able to bring their content with them, although third-party services such as Spotify have helped erode this situation in recent years. It also bears noting that Apple's product-driven sales model also presents something of a dormant risk. Should Apple somehow badly misstep with one of its annual device designs, its sales could suffer dramatically. Thanks to Apple's consistent device leadership, though, this situation has never come to fruition.

At IBM, the company's longtime relationships with customers and the large percentage of its sales that come from its legacy three-pronged business model provide it with something of a competitive moat as well. However, with the rise of the cloud-computing era and IBM's evolving place in that space, the company's competitive stance has perhaps weakened slightly. To cite one popular -- and important -- metric, IBM's sales have now declined for 18 consecutive quarters. IBM's backlog of prearranged service bookings also fell 0.7% in constant currency terms in its most recent quarter, although IBM still carries roughly 1.5 years' worth of revenue as bookings.

Winner: tie.

3. Valuation

On the surface, Apple and IBM appear to be comparably valued. In terms of their current P/E, forward P/E, and EV/EBITDA ratios, there appears to be little difference between the two at first glance.

Company P/E Ratio Forward P/E Ratio EV/EBITDA Apple 14.3 11.8 9.2 IBM 13.7 12.1 11.1

Pay extra attention to the EV/EBITDA ratio. It's arguably the most useful valuation metric, because it takes into account each company's equity, debt, and cash positions. This is particularly important to consider when analyzing a cash-rich company like Apple, which currently carries $12.73 in cash per share on its balance sheet. Subtracting that cash amount out gives investors a clearer sense of the value the market places on Apple's core operations.

Apple and IBM are both cheap compared with the market as a whole. In fact, after its recent rally, the S&P 500 benchmark trades at a valuation of 26, nearly double that of either Apple or IBM. This steep discount to the market reflects the view that Apple and IBM will probably exhibit little to no growth in the near term, which may not actually be the case. Though their revenue growth outlook isn't particularly rosy -- Apple and IBM sales are expected to rise 6% and fall 2%, respectively, this year -- both companies are among the most effective users of dividends and stock buybacks to drive shareholder returns. In terms of the overall attractiveness of their valuations, though, Apple wins this category as well.

Winner: Apple.

And the winner is... Apple

Apple's edge in two of the three categories examined here make the iPhone maker the more attractive option today. However, that isn't to say that IBM, especially in light of its own cheap valuation, is not a buy. In fact, I like both Apple and IBM shares as interesting potential buys at a time when cheap shares of high-quality companies are becoming increasingly scarce.

So while Apple is the technical winner of this exercise, investors looking for blue-chip technology stocks to buy would do well to further investigate both Apple and IBM shares today. Why Peter Thiel Is Wrong About Apple  Did Apple's Airpods Strategy Backfire? Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) CEO Tim Cook had said in December that AirPods were a runaway success and the company is "making them just as fast as we can" in order to meet demand. While he did not back his statement up with any figures then, a report from Slice Intelligence corroborates his view.

The report reveals that following the launch of Apple AirPods on December 13, Apple has cornered 26 percent of the U.S. wireless headphone market. Add to this the contribution of Apple-owned Beats (15.4 percent) and Apple's market share swells to 41.4 percent.

This is a significant positive for Apple since the earphones and headphones market is expected to exceed USD 18 billion by 2023. Grabbing a bigger pie of this growing market now will support Apple's revenues going forward. Even though AirPods might not immediately be the next big revenue generator for Apple, they can surely make a difference between a hit and a miss in earnings.

Now, all of this sounds very good and convincing at first. But, an investor must try to look beyond the obvious and find out the weak points. In the case of AirPods, Apple is becoming a victim of cannibalization. Wikipedia explains cannibalization in the simplest terms as,

"In marketing strategy, cannibalization refers to a reduction in sales volume, sales revenue, or market share of one product as a result of the introduction of a new product by the same producer."

For Apple, AirPods are probably eating Beats' lunch. The recent craze for AirPods has had a debilitating effect on Beats' market share. Before the launch of Apple's wireless earphones, Beats commanded a 24.1 percent market share, which has now dropped to 15.4 percent.

This is a matter of slight concern because all the wireless Beats headphones are expensive (> $190) than Apple AirPods which cost $159. This is a minimum $30 difference per unit which becomes more striking when the higher-end (high margin) Beats headphones begin to take a hit. This clearly means that Apple will have to sell many more of its AirPods to primarily cover the loss of revenue from the declining Beats sales. After that only can AirPods begin to support the total revenue. But, this is just the beginning and we should probably wait for more data before arriving at a conclusion.

Unfortunately for us, we will never truly know how well the AirPods are performing since it will be hidden in the "Other Products" segment of earnings which includes Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats products, and others.

It is also a bit myopic to blame AirPods for the decline in Beats' market share. During the same period, Bose has witnessed a sharp jump in market share, from 10.5 percent to 16.1 percent. But, if Bose (and others) is the reason for a decline in Beats' share, then it's all the more troubling.

While I have talked about the revenue challenge arising due to cannibalization, I must also state what might challenge this theory.

It could be just a temporary phenomenon that fans postponed their Beats purchases to try out the new Apple wireless earphones which are less costly and have received nice reviews.

Before blindly trusting the SI data, it is also important to understand the methodology behind the data. Slice Intelligence explains their methodology as,

"Our retailer-independent methodology precisely measures commerce as it happens. By extracting detailed information from hundreds of millions of aggregated and anonymized e-receipts, Slice can map the entire Purchase Graph, connecting each and every consumer to all their purchases. Slice gets its data from e-receipts - not a browser, app or software installed by the end-user - so its measurement reflects comprehensive shopping behavior across multiple devices, over time which is the key in an increasingly omni-channel retail world."

In simple terms, the market share infograph presented above is not based on the number of units sold but rather on the spending patterns of online U.S. consumers. For the market share data above, SI analyzed e-receipts of 188,470 U.S. online shoppers and tracked how much they had spent on a particular product. This is too small an audience in my opinion since Apple alone has millions of customers around the world, and it is barely a month since the launch.

It is also highly possible that the real numbers are far different from what has been presented above since the data is not directly linked to raw shipments of products.

So, it is unnecessary to view AirPods as "a runaway success" as the CEO claimed it to be, without factoring in the dent caused to Beats market share. In fact, there are signs of cannibalization, and it is only with time that we can know if Apple's AirPods strategy backfired or not.

Apple loses battle to avoid UK import taxes on watch straps - The Telegraph

Observations From Apple's Earnings Report iPhone 7 doing better than the iPhone 6s? Hard to say.

I'm currently neutral on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), but still follow the stock as Apple exerts a large influence on the entire market, through having the largest market capitalization.

Apple just released its Q1 FY2017 earnings report, and I have a large number of observations to make. Here we go:

Apple continues to be an extremely profitable company trading at an undemanding valuation. It trades for 13.9x FY2017 EPS consensus, and 10.6x ex-net cash ($158.54 billion).

($158.54 billion). Apple is ever more reliant on the iPhone. As of Q1 FY2017, the iPhone represented 69.4% of sales, and a much higher share of profits (I put the iPhone's share above 80%).

As of Q1 FY2017, the iPhone represented 69.4% of sales, and a much higher share of profits (I put the iPhone's share above 80%). The iPhone itself grew 5% year on year both in units and revenues. That's an additional 3.5 million units. However, last year's quarter did not have the iPhone SE (launched in late March 2016). Thus, it's likely that either the iPhone 7 or the 7+6s+6 complex actually stagnated or decreased in terms of sales.

(launched in late March 2016). Thus, it's likely that either the iPhone 7 or the 7+6s+6 complex actually stagnated or decreased in terms of sales. The iPhone ASP (Average Selling Price) increased in spite of the inclusion of the iPhone SE ($690 in Q1 FY2016, $694 in Q1 FY2017). This was positive but somewhat expected, since the iPhone 7 Plus has been a large success, gaining mix share . I attribute its attractiveness to more-evident changes, like the inclusion of the double camera. Also certainly helping ASP, but not disclosed by Apple, will have been the inclusion of a lot more storage in the higher tiers, making it more of a deal to buy at least the middle tier. Previously, the lower tier had 16GB in storage and the middle tier had 64GB. With the iPhone 7 this jumped to 32GB and 128GB, so while previously an additional 48GB cost $100, now $100 bought an additional 96GB. In my view this shifted the mix towards higher capacities and thus higher ASPs .

The iPad continued its implosion, down 19% year-on-year in terms of units and 22% in terms of revenues. iPad's shrinkage is now lasting for years.

The Mac grew surprisingly little in terms of units (+1%) but a bit more in terms of revenues (+7%). I say "surprisingly little" because Q1 FY2017 included the launch of the new MacBook Pros.

in terms of units (+1%) but a bit more in terms of revenues (+7%). I say "surprisingly little" because Q1 FY2017 included the launch of the new MacBook Pros. Apple Services was a bright spot , showing 18% year-on-year growth. There is an ongoing effort to focus on this line as a way to dismiss the iPhone's overwhelming importance. However, if iPhone demand ever flags, services would just follow it with a delay. Services also will have some component of increased new revenue streams helping growth.

However, if iPhone demand ever flags, services would just follow it with a delay. Services also will have some component of increased new revenue streams helping growth. Apple guided for Q2 FY2017 revenues of between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion. The midpoint ($52.5 billion) as well as the high-end of the range are below the existing $53.94 billion consensus . At the midpoint the guidance represents revenue growth below 4%.

. At the midpoint the guidance represents revenue growth below 4%. The rest of Apple's guidance also implies midpoint EPS of ~$2.01 per share, which comes slightly below existing consensus at $2.09 , even though this consensus had been heading lower recently.

, even though this consensus had been heading lower recently. Apple is known to sandbag , so guidance being only slightly below consensus might not be seen as much of a negative.

, so guidance being only slightly below consensus might not be seen as much of a negative. Apple reported a large (-12%) year-on-year drop in Greater China revenues. However, I put this down to an early iPhone 7 release there, which fell on Q4 FY2016 this cycle, versus Q1 FY2016 last year.

My Additional Take

Before Apple reported, I was actually surprised at how undemanding the revenue consensus was (+2.0%). There were no news of in-quarter iPhone 7 weakness going into the print, plus:

Apple had the iPhone SE which wasn't in the comparison base.

A direct competitor, the Samsung Note 7, was removed from the market in Q1 FY2017, versus a Samsung Note 5 competing healthily during Q1 FY2016.

Apple had the MacBook Pro launch during Q1 FY2017.

Unsurprisingly, Apple beat the revenue consensus. But it didn't beat it by much, and the guidance for next quarter was actually pretty weak. Not just was guidance below the existing consensus, but it implies a sequential revenue drop of 33% this year versus 33.3% last year, or nearly the same. Last year Q2 FY2016's report was seen as very weak and actually led to a significant sell-off in Apple shares.

All of this said, we're now approaching the moment where the iPhone 8 will start being leaked. We can expect the first realistic leaks around mid-March. Apple is likely to already be trading "under the influence" as the market is buying a super cycle, plus I expect Apple to try and wring higher prices from its customers, just like Samsung and Google seem set to do.

Putting it all together, this all seems very neutral to me. Not warranting much of a rally, and not warranting much of a sell-off either. Come mid-March, and just from the first iPhone 8 leaks, we should have a better perspective on how Apple stands to do. After all, this earnings report just continued to confirm that Apple is the iPhone, and wherever the iPhone goes, so will the stock price. Intel Corporation Gets an Apple Inc. iPhone 7 Boost Finally, microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) has managed to achieve a real degree of success in the market for chips that go into smartphones. A while back, it was revealed that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had chosen to use Intel as a second source for the LTE modems that power its iPhone.

Now, while some investors may have worried that Intel might be "giving away" these cellular modems -- in a move similar to what the company did with its Bay Trail tablet processors (i.e. providing platform cost offsets valued more than the selling prices of the chips) -- the company's most recent financial results show that this is very clearly not the case.

The big modem boost

Intel's modem sales fall under its Client Computing Group (CCG), which derives the bulk of its revenue from sales of processors and other components that go into personal computers. When Intel reports financial results for CCG, it gives investors two numbers to chew on: platform revenue and "other" revenue. Platform revenue is made up of processor and accompanying chipset (also known as a PCH) sales, while "other" revenue refers to a smorgasbord of other complementary technologies, including cellular modems.

We can see that Intel is seeing a very large boost in cellular modem sales because Intel's revenue from "other" went from $356 million in the fourth quarter of 2015 -- when Intel sold precisely zero modems to Apple -- to $773 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 -- when Intel is known to be selling modems to Apple.

Of course, it's likely that not all of that increase is due to the ramp up in cellular modem shipments -- Intel did take the time to highlight that it enjoyed record Wi-Fi chip shipments last quarter -- but there's really nothing else that can explain the substantial majority of that increase.

What does this revenue increase tell us?

The bad news is that we can't deduce too much about the profitability of these modems solely from these results -- though Intel did indicate later in the call that cellular modem shipments during 2017 would serve as a headwind to the company's gross profit margins. So we know that the modems are sold at lower than corporate average margins.

What we can deduce is this, however: Intel isn't providing excessive "contra-revenue" payments to get these modems into the iPhone because Intel is generating positive revenue -- and significant revenue at that -- from its modems. (Although we already knew this because Intel would almost have certainly disclosed to investors in advance that a ramp of its modem shipments would detract from operating profit.) If that were the case, some investors may have wanted to see the financial evidence before believing it.

Looking ahead

If we assume that Intel is going to continue to supply Apple with modems beyond the iPhone 7 -- and the odds of this look good -- then there are some interesting financial implications. First, Intel's share at Apple may be set to grow in the coming product cycle. Right now, Intel is in some portion of the iPhone 7 models, but is completely absent from the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s.

Once Apple releases new models and waterfalls the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to serve as its mid-range offerings -- and if we assume that Intel and Qualcomm get roughly equivalent order allocations during the next iPhone cycle to what we're seeing with the iPhone 7 series -- then Intel's share will necessarily go up. I also wouldn't be surprised to see Intel inside of a future iPhone SE, as well.

It's reasonable to expect that Intel will see some nice year-over-year growth in the "other" portion of CCG over the course of 2017, with acceleration happening in the second half of the year, due to the launch of the new iPhone models.

Investment Conclusion - Avoid/Short Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)

We believe long-only investors should avoid AAPL, and those that can take short/derivative positions should consider purchasing Out-of-the-Money (OTM) Puts expiring on/after 7/21/17, enough time for the fundamental thesis to begin to play out and be recognized. The core of our thesis is that AAPL has lost its long-standing ability to innovate. In fact, we now believe that AAPL has become an innovation laggard compared to mega-cap tech peers Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and even Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), a company AAPL has continuously mocked as a copycat.

For us, innovation is the most crucial element in AAPL's future success and growth - not brand cache, not economies of scale, and not even iOS ecosystem lock-in. Correspondingly, AAPL's lack of innovation suggests ensuing share loss in its core markets (i.e., smartphones, tablets, PCs) that have already ceased growing, as well as an inability to even fast-follow in emerging areas such as voice-driven home assistants (e.g., Amazon's Alexa and Google Now) and augmented/virtual reality.

There are two especially glaring areas where we believe AAPL dropped the ball: a fully integrated TV set and a large form factor touchscreen computer. Deteriorating fundamentals in AAPL's present markets, combined with its failure to enter major new markets, will likely result in single-digit revenue contractions for each of the next three years, as opposed to consensus revenue growth estimates of 6% and 7% for FY17 and FY18 respectively (no FY19 estimates yet). Unless management becomes much more risk tolerant and changes how they make product decisions, we do not see a positive growth catalyst until 5G rollout likely prompts a strong iPhone upgrade cycle in 2020-2021.

In addition to our "end of innovation" thesis, we also want to highlight other data points underlying our bearish AAPL opinion:

AAPL now has a negative net cash position of $19b and an absolute cash position of $67b (far less than the $100b+ it has had over the last several years), so cash repatriation on any favorable tax terms the Trump administration might extend will not be as positive an event as it would have been a few years ago.

extend will not be as positive an event as it would have been a few years ago. FY16 (ended 9/24/16) iPhone revenue, which accounted for 63% of AAPL's total, fell 12% from FY15, its first full-year decline.

The global smartphone market appears to be finally approaching saturation, with an installed base equal to half of the adult global population, and even under-penetrated countries such as India saw only single-digit smartphone growth in 2016.

Smartphone upgrade periods are now lengthening significantly. During 2009-2014, the U.S. averaged a steady 22.5 months but bumped up to 28.4 months in 2015. The 2016 estimate is 30 months and is forecast to continue to grow in 2017 (Source: Recon Analytics).

Other AAPL products cannot come to the rescue, including tablets (two consecutive years of sales declines) and PCs (a flat-to-down market where AAPL is also losing market share). The Apple Watch, at <2% of total revenue, is too small to make any top line impact.

We will publish a follow-on to this Brief (our upcoming AAPL CSAR report), with a focused analysis backing our investment conclusion. This piece explains the thematic reasoning behind our call as a prelude to the AAPL CSAR.

AAPL's BIG innovation problem.

We believe AAPL has lost its innovation mojo. Worse, it does not appear that management realizes the severity of the problem, and we see no sign of a change in course to reinvigorate the breakthrough product innovation that has made AAPL the most valuable company in the world. Of course, no corporate fate is set in stone, and certainly not AAPL's, given its history of proving naysayers wrong. AAPL still employs some of the most creative and brilliant minds in tech and is still a leader in the realms of creating intuitive software user interfaces, designing sleek hardware, building and feeding a vibrant developer community, and forging novel win-win partnerships.

Yet, following the 2011 death of Steve Jobs, it seems as if AAPL has turned downright risk-averse regarding product development. Whether consciously or subconsciously motivated, AAPL executives presently appear more focused on tending to the iPod/iPhone/iPad annuity stream, as opposed to taking the risks necessary to create truly breakthrough, innovative products.

Maybe AAPL's executives can no longer recognize and push for product ideas with innovative blockbuster potential. An even more dire possibility: maybe they never developed that skill in the first place. After all, identifying and evaluating the commercial potential of innovations always seemed to be controlled by Jobs. Maybe, without Jobs, AAPL's leadership has become so divided and dysfunctional internally they can only achieve lose-lose compromises, always sacrificing groundbreaking potential for short-term safety and the preservation of inter-departmental harmony.

Obviously, we are just speculating here about the reasons for AAPL's innovation funk, but the conclusion holds so much historical precedence that it is almost a clich . Countless tech companies of all sizes have lost the ability to innovate after the loss of a key founder/CEO. We know this: Steve Jobs did not care about preserving inter-departmental harmony. In fact, time and again, he seemed to deliberately cause discord among his direct reports for effect, sacrificing harmony not just to preserve innovation at AAPL, but to help accelerate it.

To be fair, Jobs was one of the most innovative CEOs ever with an uncanny ability to guide R&D, decide exactly which technologies were ready for prime time, and turn those technologies into products that wowed customers and enhanced AAPL's brand and overall cool factor. Expecting the same pace of product innovation AAPL maintained under Jobs is unrealistic, but we did not expect innovation at AAPL to come to a complete halt, as now appears to be the case.

Although we acknowledge Tim Cook as an excellent executive, we believe his core competencies - i.e., operations and supply-chain management - would make him a much better fit as the CEO of another F500 company. Innovation, vision, and evangelism are not his strongest attributes, and in our opinion, those are exactly the attributes AAPL needs to bring back its innovation mojo.

Under Tim Cook, not only has AAPL not come up with enough new products, it has failed to productize several innovations spearheaded by Jobs where much of the difficult R&D work was already completed. We believe there are a number of compelling, game-changing "products-to-be" currently stuck in the AAPL R&D basement. To be clear, the problem does not lie with R&D and early-product-development teams. Rather, we think that management is simply unwilling to take the chances needed to create the kind of innovative, category-defining products that would prevent a long-term revenue decline.

In press interviews and corporate presentations over the last few years, AAPL execs have given uninspiring and unconvincing reasons why they did not green light products that were eagerly anticipated by analysts, pundits, and loyal customers. An integrated TV set and a large form factor touch-based computer are the leading examples here, and the arguments that AAPL execs have made in support of their decisions feel more like the excuses of an organization content to play defense.

It seems to us as if AAPL execs have forgotten two of the key and interrelated principles behind truly innovative product development:

The concept of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that delivers concrete incremental value to the customer, prioritizes time-to-market, and quickly incorporates feedback from the early adopter customers; and parlaying the initial incremental value of an MVP into subsequent product versions that deliver truly transformational value.

To understand and contextualize AAPL's present innovation malaise, we examine two of AAPL's most notable transformational products - the iPod and the iPhone - under the lens of this incremental-to-transformational innovation framework.

Innovation's Own Process: Parlaying Incremental Value into Transformational Value

Our incremental-to-transformational value construct is inspired by Geoffrey Moore's seminal work, Crossing the Chasm that lays out his often-referenced theory on new technology adoption. In Moore's theory, a new tech product - the MVP - does not have to be immediately transformational in order to "cross the chasm" between early adopters who buy technology for technology's sake and the larger population of mainstream customers who buy technology for more practical reasons.

In Moore's parlance, a new tech product only needs to knock down a single "bowling pin," his term for a customer niche with more specific requirements than the overall mainstream.

Knocking down that first pin can then be parlayed into knocking down adjacent bowling pins by modifying/upgrading the product to deliver incremental value to other niches with similar but still different customer requirements. Once a product delivers value to and gains traction in enough niches, it can "cross the chasm" and mainstream adoption takes off. From there, the product can realize the transformational value potential it inherently possessed when conceived.

The iPod and the iPhone are some of the most innovative products ever. (So too was the iPad, though for the sake of brevity, we are leaving that story on the cutting-room floor.) We remember both products for their "transformational value" and the entirely new markets they created. We tend to forget the path they took on their way to becoming the ubiquitous, wildly successful, and transformational products by which we now remember them.

The histories of the iPod and iPhone serve as textbook examples and reminders of how AAPL became one of the most successfully innovative tech companies ever. They also serve as a comparative backdrop for today, illuminating AAPL's loss of innovation mojo.

The iPod Started Incremental 

When the original iPod was released in the fall of 2001, the iTunes store did not exist. In order to load music into the iPod, the customer first took the music CDs they owned and loaded them one after another into their Mac running iTunes software (Windows support came about 20 months later). iTunes automatically copied the songs from the CDs to the Mac, translating their digital format into AAPL's proprietary iTunes format. From that point, the user connected the iPod to their Mac, and iTunes automatically copied the songs from the Mac to the iPod.

Today, that process seems quite awkward and labor-intensive, but it was a big leap forward during a time with 5-foot-tall CD racks and cumbersome CD travel cases. With the iPod, those who wanted to take and listen to their entire music collection on the road could now do so with a single pocket-sized device. The original iPod (including iTunes) is a classic example of an MVP targeted a specific bowling pin. There were any number of features we have come to strongly associate with the iPod that were missing in the original.

Yet, the iPod delivered significant incremental value to a specific niche - Mac-owning music lovers who travel. Based on the incremental value delivered to that niche, AAPL sold about 600,000 iPods in the 14 months following its initial release in October 2001. That was a considerable achievement given the historical context: The telecom/dot-com bubbles had just burst, 9/11 happened two months before the iPod's release, and AAPL did not yet possess nearly the brand appeal it did by 2010.

iTunes makes the iPod Transformational

In April 2003, AAPL introduced the iTunes Store, enabling customers to buy music for the iPod online. In our opinion, that is when the iPod jumped from incremental to transformational. Building on the initial traction gained by providing substantial incremental value to a comparatively small - but dedicated and vocal - customer base of Mac-owning, music-loving frequent travelers, AAPL could then justify a bump in R&D to expand the addressable market (e.g., to develop a Windows version of iTunes).

The iPod's initial traction also helped AAPL's negotiating position when it forged the deal with the record companies necessary to make the transformational iPod + iTunes Store combination a reality. We will admit that AAPL was aided at that time by the music industry's fear of illegal downloading, still spooked by the brief but tremendous success of free music downloading site Napster. With this combination of strategy, timing, and luck, AAPL parlayed the iPod's initial incremental value into truly transformational value delivered to the much larger mainstream.

By coupling the iPod to iTunes and the iTunes Store, AAPL successfully created portable music-playing devices that were not only far superior to any alternative, but completely revolutionized how people bought and consumed music and massively disrupted the structure of the entire music industry.

The iPhone Started Incremental 

We believe the iPhone is an even more powerful example of an MVP that initially delivered compelling incremental value and was then parlayed into delivering transformational value. In doing so, AAPL disrupted yet another entire industry: mobile handsets. Like the original iPod, the original iPhone, released in June 2007, lacked many of the features that drove its mainstream adoption, with the biggest missing piece in our opinion being the complete lack of third-party applications.

Some might argue that the iPhone's multi-touch interface created transformational value, and a case could be made for that. After all, deciding whether the value that a product delivers is "transformational" or "incremental" is highly subjective, with the difference often bordering on the merely semantic. However, even if one is convinced that multi-touch was the iPhone's transformational element, we believe it was certainly not transformational from the get-go.

We believe that the full realization of the multi-touch interface and the transformational value it carried was the result of a superior ability to browse the Web anywhere, anytime. That multi-touch-driven mobile-browsing capability was only truly realized with the 3G version of the iPhone released a year after the original. In fact, we would argue that, although it was compelling and one could get a glimpse of its transformational potential when connected via Wi-Fi, multi-touch browsing on the original 2G iPhone was too painfully slow to offer even much incremental value.

We argue that the original iPhone's key incremental value was simply integrating an iPod with a mobile phone. That, along with a good dose of residual "Think Different" brand cache, enabled AAPL to sell enough of the first iPhone to justify its investment. Some may have different recollections, but we remember clearly that, following the disastrous integration of "iPod functionality" with Motorola's Rokr phone, many die-hard and vocal iPod customers were chomping at the bit for a product that combined the two devices they loved most and wanted in their pocket at all times.

An Aside: Former Smartphone Competitors Though it may seem odd now, in 2008, many believed the smartphone market tide would raise all boats. Most thought that both Research in Motion (NASDAQ:BBRY)-of Blackberry fame-and Nokia (NYSE:NOK)-with its 35% smartphone market share -- would piggyback the iPhone success and continue to grow. After all, the prevailing wisdom was that RIM's Blackberry had a lock on business users and its loyal customers would never give up their physical keyboard for an on-screen one. Similarly, most assumed NOK would continue to dominate the more price-sensitive end of the market due to scale, brand, and tight relationships with telcos worldwide. However, if one saw the inherent transformational value of the iPhone as a platform for "mobile computing apps", the challenge for RIMM and NOK was clear. Sensing that their ability to catalyze and feed third party software developers would be crucial for both NOK and RIMM, we (well, actually only one of us at a previous firm) engaged in a cursory due diligence project to determine the magnitude of their challenge to attract and keep third party app developers to both NOK handsets running the Symbian operating system and RIM handsets running its BBOS platform. The interviews we conducted in early 2009 convinced us NOK and BBRY were likely in trouble. With NOK, developing apps on Symbian required: Fluency in Symbian C++, an altered and more-difficult version of standard C++, itself having a steep learning curve;

That individual applications be tweaked significantly for each phone/device; and

An "almost manual" debugging process with only marginally helpful tools, most from the 1980's. As for developing for the Blackberry, the consensus was that it was basically a non-starter. One developer with whom we spoke literally just laughed when we asked about development on the Blackberry, not even dignifying the question with a verbal response. - Samadhi Partners

The demand for this iPod + handset combo, frequently voiced by AAPL fanatics and some general consumers alike in 2005 and 2006, now seems forgotten. However, we firmly believe it was the incremental value of the iPod + handset combo, along with a good dose of residual "Think Different" brand cache, that enabled AAPL to knock over its first bowling pin to the tune of five million iPhone customers within the first year of its release.

An SDK and App Store make the iPhone Transformational

With a base of five million users by which to attract developers, AAPL did two things in the first half of 2008 that truly marked the iPhone's jump a little later from incremental to transformational: First, it released the iPhone Software Developer's Kit (SDK) in March 2008. Second, it launched the app store for the iPhone in July 2008. Not only did AAPL open the iPhone to third-party application development, it built an unprecedented end-to-end environment and toolset making it possible to build fully featured apps within weeks.

Demonstrating the ease of iPhone app development, over 800 apps were developed and ready for download in the three months between the release of the SDK and the launch of the app store - an elegantly constructed storefront, accessible right from the iPhone, that drastically reduced the friction between buyers and sellers of apps.

Together, the iOS SDK and the app store enabled AAPL, extending Geoffrey Moore's bowling analogy from Crossing the Chasm, to knock over a huge number of bowling pins without significantly increasing its level of effort. More specifically, by making iOS apps so easy to build and sell, AAPL enlisted an army of third-party developers so large that soon there existed at least one compelling application to match the desires of virtually any iPhone customer.

By the end of 2008, AAPL sold an additional seven million iPhones and third parties contributed approximately 6,700 new apps. iPhone users cumulatively recorded more than 400 million app downloads in 2008. The exploding growth of the iPhone community attracted even more apps and developers, which, in turn, attracted more iPhone customers, initiating one of the most remarkable and lucrative feedback loops in tech-sector history: Users attracting developers, developers making apps, and apps attracting more users, ad infinitum. By 2009, despite the grave economic uncertainty of the times, AAPL had successfully built a revolutionary product that created transformational value.

Please forgive us for the history lesson, but we felt it was a necessary backdrop to explain why we think AAPL has lost its innovation mojo. Now, let's look at two product ideas - the integrated TV set and the large form factor touchscreen computer - that share the following four characteristics: 1. AAPL has already completed most of the difficult R&D work to turn these ideas into products, 2. each holds the potential to be truly transformational, 3. the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for each is large enough to significantly improve AAPL's top and bottom lines, and 4. there exists significant risk of high-profile failure.

Punting the TV Set

In Walter Isaacson's biography of Jobs - which, for reference, was published shortly after the subject's 2011 passing - Jobs expresses unabashed zeal about the R&D progress AAPL had already made in creating a truly integrated, flat-screen TV. Isaacson writes:

"[Steve Jobs] very much wanted to do for television sets what he had done for computers, music players, and phones: make them simple and elegant. 'I'd like to create an integrated television set that is completely easy to use,' he told me. 'It would be seamlessly synced with all of your devices and with iCloud.' No longer would users have to fiddle with complex remotes for DVD players and cable channels. 'It will have the simplest user interface you could imagine. I finally cracked it.'"

To be clear, the above-described product is wholly different than the current AAPL TV product, which, in our view, is not much more than an overpriced iPod with an HDMI interface. The "integrated television set" envisioned by Jobs has not been brought to market even after six years from that conversation. Per a May 18th, 2015 article in The Wall Street Journal, AAPL is said to have given up completely on the idea of a television set sometime during 2014, although this was never officially confirmed or denied by AAPL.

We found the arguments offered against an Apple TV set in the article particularly curious, if not laughable (text bolding added for emphasis):

"Apple had searched for breakthrough features to justify building an Apple-branded television set, those people said. In addition to an ultra-high-definition display, Apple considered adding sensor-equipped cameras so viewers could make video calls through the set. Ultimately, though, Apple executives didn't consider any of those features compelling enough to enter the highly competitive television market, led by Samsung Electronics Co."

Virtually every aspect of how we control our TVs has been begging for a complete re-think and re-design for what seems like decades now, including confusing, easy-to-lose, hard-to-use remote controls, as well as the notoriously counterintuitive, awkward, and sometimes downright infuriating software interfaces to control the basic functions of the TV. In our view, AAPL is simply not telling a credible story in suggesting that there are no features it could add to a television product that would be compelling enough for success in the market.

First of all, since when has AAPL shied away from jumping into a market dominated by incumbents with long histories? A strong argument can be made that portable music players, music stores, and mobile handsets possessed more daunting competition than an AAPL TV set would have faced in 2013 or even today for that matter. To be sure, TV-set market-share leader Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) possesses several advantages that make it a formidable competitor: An extensive global distribution network; design and manufacturing processes honed to ensure very high quality at low cost; and, perhaps most significant, vertical integration for many of the most critical, high-cost TV components such as the flat panel display, the LEDs and OLEDs in the display, DRAM, and image processors.

However, Samsung is not known for user-friendly, intuitive software interfaces; slick hardware design; innovative ergonomics; or, frankly, much of any truly breakthrough innovation in consumer electronics (Samsung is, however, an innovation standout when it comes to physical layer technologies, components, and semiconductor manufacturing). Core competence and innovation in these areas are supposed to be AAPL's calling cards, and it has used them to successfully battle Samsung and minimize its advantages in other areas, most obviously and importantly in smart phones.

Samsung also does not possess AAPL's massive developer community, let alone a knack for building and feeding such a developer community. Last, and perhaps most importantly, Samsung does not possess AAPL's brand, which features a core cult of tens of millions of global members, most of whom fall into the highest-income, least-price-sensitive demographic. AAPL's cult-member customers jump at the opportunity to buy virtually any product AAPL proclaims to be the next big thing, and the television, in our opinion, would have been no exception. In fact, after the 1994 retirement of Sony's legendary and truly ground-breaking founder/CEO, Akio Morita, it is hard to call any TV maker "innovative," particularly compared to AAPL.

Jobs was unambiguous in his belief that a change was needed in how we controlled our television. Our conversations with former AAPL execs and with key AAPL-supplier employees made it clear to us that Jobs had a particular solution in mind: he wanted to integrate Siri, AAPL's voice recognition software, with the TV. Critics will cite two main problems with using Siri as a TV control mechanism, as opposed to its original purpose of answering open-ended queries:

The first is the potential for too many voice recognition errors. People might not mind repeating general questions to Siri, but a high error rate for basic television control commands would be highly frustrating.

The second is what would be an intolerably long response time. Once the audio signal of a user's verbal command is properly translated into words, a long delay would follow if Siri were to operate the way it does normally, which is to send recognized words as text via the Internet to Siri's knowledge servers in AAPL's data center, looking up and retrieving the command corresponding to the words, and sending that command all the way back to the TV for execution.

AAPL's Difficulty with Difficulties

These two issues would not have been difficult to overcome at all. AAPL could have created and installed a "subset" version of Siri with a vocabulary limited only to relevant television control commands, programming titles, and a few selected content descriptions of the available programming (e.g., genre, actors, the director, season, etc.).

That vocabulary could easily fit into less than 1GB of solid-state, NAND Flash storage in the TV and goes a long way toward alleviating both the recognition accuracy and delay problems. A limited vocabulary would substantially improve voice-recognition accuracy, and storing that vocabulary locally on the TV set eliminates the need to send the voice commands via the Internet and back for word-to-meaning resolution.

With the substantially larger circuit board real estate on a TV compared to an iPhone, AAPL could have employed the latest Digital Signal Processors (DSPs), throwing a lot more processing power directly at the task of voice recognition. Finally, a TV set has the necessary real estate to employ larger, more accurate microphones, also improving voice recognition accuracy.

When Siri debuted on the iPhone 4 in 2011, its voice recognition error rate was ~18%, high but tolerable for general queries. By employing the previously mentioned "TV Siri" with its subset TV command vocabulary, the latest DSPs, larger mics, and other advances that AAPL could have made between 2011 through 2013, we believe an integrated AAPL TV set launched in early 2014 could have achieved a voice recognition error rate of less than 5%.

By comparison, today's leading voice recognition systems (e.g., Siri, Google Now, Amazon Echo, and Microsoft's Cortana) can now attain word recognition error rates at or below 5%, and that is for the entire universe of vocabulary for general questions, not the comparatively limited command and content-related vocabulary TV Siri would have required.

The question, we suppose, is whether a voice-driven interface for a TV set would have represented enough incremental value for a successful MVP. We believe the answer is a self-evident and resounding "YES." For those who need a little more convincing about there being enough potential customers for such a voice-driven MVP TV set, we provide some anecdotes in the sidebar, "On the State of the Human/TV Interface." Any similarity between these anecdotes and real-life events is purely coincidental  Those already convinced of the latent demand for a new way to control the TV may skip this sidebar.

Aside: On the State of the Human/TV Interface Unlike the apparent opinion of AAPL execs, we believe there are many people who would see substantial incremental value in a TV set product featuring a well-designed voice-driven interface that could interpret and execute direct, verbal commands and perform content searches. The people who would be ideal candidates to buy such a TV set, even if it were an MVP, might fall under the following hypotheticals, including anyone who has ever   used one of the unbelievably obtuse, counterintuitive, remote-button-driven Electronic Programming Guides (EPGs). (To this day, EPG's continue to adhere to a rigid structure that was standardized way back in the 1980s.)  felt the aggravation of navigating a maze of pointless Yes/No toggle screens, infinitely nested drop-down menus, and circular jump commands just to turn on closed captioning but without changing the default language from English to Mandarin.  taken almost ten minutes to fat finger and search for "I Just Remembered That I Still Know What You Did Last Summer III" using the remote's cramped arrow buttons and a painfully small, on-screen, "select-a-letter" grid.  hurled the remote against a TV screen after scrolling through 1,000+ channels desperately trying to catch a sporting event before it ends, such as, for example, the overtime finish of the UVA vs. Hopkins NCAA lacrosse playoff game that was one of several simultaneously broadcast NCAA lacrosse games from Divisions I, II, and III, including both women's and men's playoffs and being supremely frustrated because the EPG program descriptions are all cut off from view in "scroll mode," forcing you to stop at each channel entry and hit that tiny "more info" button, which, of course, you eventually miss, hitting the adjacent button that returns the TV to the Pay-Per-View movie watched, Paris Hilton's 2008 classic The Hottie and the Nottie, officially making you the laughing stock among the coworkers you invited over that day. - Samadhi Partners

Of course, with any product innovative, laggard, or retro, strong execution on one or two key features is always necessary for success. In this case, strong execution might entail the addition of a mechanism to visually recognize a set of predefined hand gestures, which might be less intrusive to other viewers in the room for common commands like volume control. It would totally make sense for TV Siri to be able to switch to "general query mode," which would essentially be the same Siri as the one running on one's iPhone.

Further, it might be a good option to keep this more generalized version of Siri turned on and recording 24/7 to accelerate the improvement of its voice recognition and language-learning algorithms and to be able to differentiate between different family members' voices-just like Amazon Echo can do today.

This leads us to what might be the most problematic aspect of AAPL's swing-and-miss in the TV space. Like AMZN's Echo, TV Siri could soon have been tweaked and expanded to serve any number of non-TV functions, including the ability to play content from iTunes, order content from the iTunes Store, or run immersive, multi-media language learning applications-all by just talking. Given that the TV remains the physical centerpiece of most living rooms, an AAPL TV set running Siri could have served as a critical first step towards introducing home AI.

This still-nascent home AI market-presently dominated by competitors Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, among others-is estimated by Grand View Research to explode to $12b by 2024, up from less than $1b this year, and we think that estimate is likely quite low. So, coming full circle, we feel that AAPL management's apparent fear of failure, manifesting in the decision not to pursue Jobs' vision for an Apple TV set, has now placed the company dangerously behind in the home AI space.

The Touch-Screen "Desktop" - Scooped by Microsoft?

Another idea that has never seen the light of day at AAPL is a fully-featured computer with a large (i.e., >15 inch/38 cm) multi-touchscreen interface. Unlike the television, the concept of a multi-touch computer has been publicly and officially rejected by two different AAPL executives. First, on October, 16, 2014, Craig Federighi, AAPL's Senior VP of Software Engineering, claimed the following on CNET:

"It's really fantastic that at AAPL we build prototypes around all sorts of ideas. We certainly explored the topic deeply many years ago and had working models. But we decided that it really was a compromise. For a device that you hold in your hand like a phone or tablet   we think touch is at its best. And, we wanted to build, and have built, a really deep experience around a "multi-touch first" user interface. Grafting touch on something that fundamentally was designed around a precise pointer really compromises the experience."

More recently on November 14th, 2016, Phil Schiller, AAPL's Senior VP of Worldwide Marketing had this to say about multi-touch on Mac:

"We think of the whole platform. If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn't be enough-then the desktop wouldn't work that way."

And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster:

"Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd."

He also explains that such a move would mean totally redesigning the menu bar for fingers, ruining the experience for those using pointer devices like the Apple Pencil or the mouse:

"You can't optimize for both   It's the lowest common denominator thinking."

Over the last few years, there have been a few other expressions by members of AAPL management, both directly quoted and referenced by the press and pundits, pointing to how awkward and tiring it would be to have to continuously reach "up" (or in Schiller's own words, "over the air") to a monitor to execute commands or manipulate objects on the screen. Essentially, one of AAPL's primary arguments against the touch-screen desktop has been ergonomic. This ergonomic problem is largely solved, however, by simply being able to position the screen flat or at a shallow angle on a "surface."

In fact, AAPL seemingly figured this out already. In 2010, AAPL filed a patent for a mechanism (EU filing number: PCT/US2009/050168) whereby adjusting the angle of the screen of a computer automatically changes "the mode of input." When the screen is vertical, the operating system remains in "mouse input mode." When the user adjusts the screen angle below some user-set threshold, the operating system switches to touch input mode.

So, in our view, two things are evident from this patent filing:

First, it is obvious to those inside AAPL, not to mention many in the field of human-computer interfaces, that a full-fledged, touch-driven computer is only ergonomically viable at flat or a shallow angle on a desk surface. In this light, Federighi's and, especially, Schiller's objections that a touch-driven interface would be awkward and tiring ring hollow. More than hollow, it sounds almost disingenuous, as if the real reason for not pursuing a touchscreen Mac or a beefed-up iPad equivalent were more related to internal politics rather than a sincerely held belief about the future of computing.

Second, it shows that someone inside of AAPL actually came up with what seems to be a reasonable solution to the "can't optimize for both" problem (i.e., both mouse and touch input modes).

Maybe we are blowing AAPL's resistance to a large form factor, touch-driven computer out of proportion. We fully understand that companies often file patents without ever productizing them. Further, we admit there is something decidedly "Apple-esque," or more appropriately, "Jobs-ian" about Schiller's aversion to that "lowest common denominator thinking." We too think Jobs would not have been fond of a "dual mode" operating system, regardless of how slick a mechanism is employed to automatically switch between modes.

The difference, however, is that we believe Jobs would not have abandoned touch, which, along with voice recognition, represents the future of the human-computer interface. Instead, Jobs would have killed the mouse, and he would have made a big damn deal about doing it too. The ad script almost writes itself: "The company that ushered in the era of the mouse and killed the command line is now ushering in the era of touch and killing the mouse."

In our opinion, AAPL should have made this move at least two if not three years ago. The technology for acceptably priced 15inch/38cm touchscreens has been ready since 2013. With a little price/performance extrapolation with Moore's Law as a rough guide, AAPL could have easily anticipated when large form-factor touchscreens would be ready for prime time.

What is more, given AAPL's expertise and track record in ergonomics, user interfaces, and making an entirely new computing context relatively easy for developers to quickly create compelling applications, it is hard to believe AAPL could not have made a touch version of OS X to go with a new line of "TouchMacs" by the end of 2014, or the end of 2015 at the very latest.

Yet, here we are in 2017 with no indication that AAPL is even close to launching a touchscreen Mac. At minimum, AAPL could have developed a "Pro" version of iOS running on a beefed up, large form factor iPad. And, if you were wondering, today's iPad Pro is not nearly beefed up enough to run apps where serious creative work is done.

To be fair, the iPad Pro does have fans among some creative professionals, mainly those who spend a lot of their time in the initial ideation and sketching phases of the content creation workflow. The creative professionals who are satisfied with the iPad Pro see it as an accessory, not a replacement, for a full-fledged Mac that can handle the most processor/memory intensive and collaborative phases of the content creation workflow.

Perhaps AAPL is simply biding its time before it releases an iPad with the processing/memory muscle running a correspondingly powerful, revamped version of iOS so that creative professionals of many types can use it to handle the entire creative workflow, from ideation to finished content. The problem is that, in our opinion, AAPL does not have the luxury to wait. The most shocking thing about AAPL's inaction regarding touchscreen computing is the fact that it appears to have been scooped by Microsoft with the Surface line in general and the Surface Studio in particular.

Released in October 2016, Surface Studio is an ergonomically well-designed, high-end 28-inch touchscreen desktop with a full 90  range of motion (flat to vertical) aimed at the most loyal core of AAPL's customers: creative professionals.

Though creative professionals are a small niche, they have been central to AAPL's success historically. We believe creative professionals serve as canaries in the coal mine and listening to them reveals insights into AAPL's creative, innovative soul. When AAPL was at its lowest point in the mid-90's and its existence as an independent entity was in jeopardy, creative professionals stayed loyal, stubbornly hanging on to the Mac platform even within Windows-dominated enterprises.

AAPL, in turn, gave back, prioritizing features this niche customer base was asking for and focusing its limited developer support funds specifically on those that produced applications for creative professionals (e.g., graphics, drawing, publishing, video/photo editing, music production, etc.).

It's Time to 'Think Different' - Again

We believe that creative professionals were an early key behind AAPL's resurgence. After Jobs took over in 1997, AAPL launched its award-winning "Think Different" ad campaign that, in effect, likened its creative professional customers to many of the most revered and innovative icons of the 20th century (Albert Einstein, Bob Dylan, Jim Henson, Richard Feynman, etc.).

The campaign accomplished three key goals that set the stage for AAPL's unprecedented corporate comeback from during 2001-2010: 1. it paid homage to its creative professional customer base, essentially thanking them for their loyalty, and, in turn, strengthening their dedication to the brand; 2. it celebrated and amplified the "cool nonconformity" of creative professionals who use AAPL products; and 3. it implied that anyone who thought of themselves as "a rebel," even if they were not a creative professional, should consider a Mac-the creative professional bowling pin knocked down the pins of the broader consumer market.

Fast forward to today and one sees numerous signs that AAPL did not just lose its innovation mojo, but that MSFT has stolen it, at least in terms of touch computing. The entire Microsoft Surface line, which admittedly experienced an awkward, slow start, is indeed now attracting creative professionals at a decent clip. Further, it seems that many of these professionals never even tried to use the iPad for professional content creation.

Most are not abandoning the iPad for the Surface. Rather, they appear to be mostly abandoning the Mac for the Surface, indicating not merely a preference for a particular "digital sketching accessory" but a migration to a completely different computing platform to handle the entire creative workflow, from ideation to finishing touches.

Regardless of whether the Surface Family is taking share from iPads or Macs, the numbers are surprising and telling: In the first three quarters of 2016, total Surface revenue was up 18% y/y to $3.1b, while iPad revenue fell 5% to $13.5b and Mac revenue fell 13% to $16.1b. What is more, these numbers do not include Surface Studio sales that went on sale in November and of all Surface models, Surface Studio is the most squarely targeted at creative professionals.

We firmly believe AAPL has opened the door wide for MSFT and potentially others to take the lead and define the future of touch computing, which represents, along with voice recognition, the future of the human-computer interface. This misstep specifically, and more generally, AAPL's overall innovation problem is certainly not a matter of resources as it is for many tech companies pressured to make more risk-averse product development decisions.

Ultimately, AAPL's innovation problem lies with CEO Tim Cook whose core competencies lie solidly in the realms of operations, logistics, and supply-chain management. Without Jobs' innate ability to define AAPL's innovative future, maybe Cook is relying too much on the consensus of his several direct reports.

Unfortunately, consensus decision-making is usually anathema to innovation. This is especially true when a CEO is trying to determine consensus among several strong-willed leaders all vying to be, at least, the visionary leader of the largest company in the world.

It is even more true when this consensus is being arbitrated by a CEO without the vision or tech chops necessary to call out his direct reports when they obfuscate, exaggerate, and manipulate. These issues occur with ambitious, capable humans in any organization. However, now that AAPL is the most valuable company in the world, the bar is much higher, especially for investors anticipating continued growth for AAPL.

We believe that AAPL can fix its innovation problem if either Cook resigns or if Cook appoints someone to be transparently and unequivocally responsible for the vision and product decisions of the company. However, we are not in the management consulting business and realistically, do not see that kind of move happening any time soon.

(AAPL) And Exxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) Ahead Of ... All investors await with bated breath to see how Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) will shake Wall Street tonight, with Apple on the brink of posting its fiscal first quarter results of 2017 and Exxon raring to release its fourth-quarter earnings.

Two analysts echo bullish sentiments with regards to Apple s upcoming print, with excited buzz surrounding the forthcoming September launch of the iPhone s 10th model, dubbed across the tech-verse as  X.  Conversely, one analyst tiptoes with more caution around Exxon after two weak spots in terms of back-to-back quarters, but with a rise in encouragement for what to expect for the fourth quarter.

Let s take a closer look:

Apple s Success and Growth for the Next 6 to 9 Months Hinge Upon the  X  Factor

Drexel Hamilton analyst Brian White paints an upbeat picture on Apple ahead of the print: one of fulfilled or outclassed expectations and a comeback kick for growth.

As such, the analyst reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AAPL with a $185 price target, which represents a just under 53% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

For the first fiscal quarter, the analyst is calling for $77.61 billion in sales, which denotes a 2% year-over-year rise, slightly ahead of the Street s $77.12 billion; an expectation, which he anticipates the giant will either meet or beat. White s projection denotes a 66% quarter-over-quarter increase, bolstered by an added week, and is over the five-year average quarter-over-quarter growth of 59% over quarters this time in previous years. However, the analyst notes the estimate also falls under the 77% growth during this quarter two years ago, thanks to the stellar performance of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus in the past.

Meanwhile, the analyst has even more positive approach to AAPL s EPS this quarter, predicting a beat for his estimate of $3.22, which is just over the Street s estimate of $3.21. Additionally, White points to the tech giant s guidance, which set expectations for sales to hit $76 to $78 billion with implied EPS circling $3.17.

White believes there was an iPhone cycle bottoming out phenomenon in the second quarter of the fiscal year of 2016, which showcased a 16% dip year-over-year, but affirms that the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus can return the tech giant to its unit growth glory days for this quarter. This is considering that the past three quarters revealed a decline in growth. White estimates AAPL will bring 76 million in iPhone units for this quarter, which would reveal a 67% quarter-over-quarter rise.

Less positively,  Although we believe Apple will benefit from the iPhone 7 launch in China, we expect Greater China revenue to fall by 20-30% YoY in 1Q:FY17 and decline by 5-10% in FY:17,  opines White.

Though largely bullish, the analyst s preview of the tech giant is not without apprehension, as he ventures,  For iPad, we are modeling 15.5 million units (down 4% YoY) in 1Q:FY17 but our estimates could be at risk. For Services, we are modeling revenue of $6.45 billion and believe Apple could beat our projections. Finally, we believe Apple Watch enjoyed a strong holiday season and AirPods (available 12/13) got off to a strong start. 

Lastly, the analyst posits,  Rising FX headwinds and the seasonal volatility after a new iPhone ramp will likely play into the company s outlook. 

Overall,  In 1Q:FY17, we look for Tim Cook to make Apple grow again on the back of the iPhone 7 and a happy holiday season, while we look forward to the launch of the iPhone  X  in September 2017. Finally, the potential for more favorable tax repatriation policies could be a positive catalyst for Apple and we recommend a 3.5-4% dividend yield. In our view, Apple remains one of the most underappreciated stocks in the world,  White contends.

As usual, we like to include the analyst s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Brian White is ranked #180 out of 4,370 analysts. White has a 61% success rate and earns 8.8% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, White yields 20.8% in average profits on the stock.

In a separate, but also bullish corner, BMO analyst Tim Long likewise is betting on Apple with full confidence, reiterating an Outperform rating on AAPL with a price target of $135, which represents a close to 12% increase from current levels.

Long s expectations surpass that of consensus, as he notes,  Our iPhone unit estimates are 3 million/2 million above consensus for results and guidance, respectively, though we believe investor concerns are currently more focused on gross margin guidance. Our FY2017/2018 EPS estimates are $9.05/$9.89, compared with consensus of$8.92/$10.05, respectively. 

For the fourth quarter, Long projects EPS will reach $3.27, above the Street s $3.22. Moreover, the analyst models a much more confident revenue forecast than that of consensus, which he attributes to robust iPhone revenue performance. Yet, the analyst adds,  Our gross margin guidance of 38.4% is slightly below the Street s 38.5%, though our lower opex view more than offsets the difference. 

Ultimately, from Long s eyes, the iPhone machine is  still key  for the tech giant, concluding,  We model 80 million iPhones in the December quarter compared with the consensus estimate of 77 million, which has been slipping in recent weeks. We are also above the Street with 55 million in the March quarter, having raised numbers last month on better post-iPhone 7 launch impressions. Discussions are starting for this year s iPhone refresh. We believe the expected success of the new models will be the main determinant of AAPL stock success over the next six to nine months. 

According to TipRanks, four-star analyst Tim Long is ranked #517 out of 4,370 analysts. Long has a 61% success rate and realizes 7.6% in his annual returns. When rating AAPL, Long gains 17.3% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate AAPL as a Strong Buy. Out of 32 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 27 are bullish on Apple stock and 5 remain sidelined. With a return potential of nearly 14%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $137.75.

Exxon Stumbled the Past 2 Quarters, but 4Q to Bring Silver Lining

J.P. Morgan analyst Phil Gresh is particularly intrigued to see how Exxon improved in its fourth quarter, considering surprise left curveballs thrown at the firm in its past two consecutive quarters. Cautious, yet with renewed optimism, the analyst reiterates a Neutral rating on XOM with a price target of $94, which represents a 12% increase from where the shares last closed.

Gresh explains,  After uncharacteristically tough quarters in 2Q and 3Q, we expect a better result from XOM in 4Q. Upstream should be aided by XOM s higher exposure to natural gas, particularly in Europe, and improving LNG prices. Downstream could also benefit from better international trends, even if domestic trends are tough. Finally, we do not expect a recurrence of the 3Q CFO headwinds. 

Looking ahead,  We expect the recent $5.6-6.6B Permian acquisition to be a key focus on the call, around which we think the company could provide more color on its broader shale outlook moving forward. We would also expect commentary around the CEO transition to be another focus, with a more thorough strategic update at the analyst day. The company might also give 2017 capex guidance, which could be positive based on recent trends,  continues the analyst.

However,  The one negative overhang remains the possibility/magnitude of any potential write-downs, though the stock has clearly lagged peers, suggesting that some of this may already be priced in,  Gresh surmises.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, four-star analyst Phil Gresh is ranked #1,009 out of 4,370 analysts. Gresh has a 65% success rate and garners 7.7% in his annual returns. When rating XOM, Gresh secured 0.0% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics exhibit XOM as a Hold. Based on 8 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 6 maintain a Hold on XOM stock while 2 issue a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $86.29, marking a nearly 3% upside from where the stock is currently trading. Currency Headwinds To Impact Apple's Earnings Though Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) earnings may not be as much of a circus as it has in the past, this particular earnings report is shrouded in many issues around the company. Analysts and bankers and their recommendations will always be a topic for consideration, but we would like to focus this earnings preview on a handful of subjects: debt, the dollar and bullish momentum.

Foreign Exchange

As the US remains the most fertile country to do business, having weathered the economic catastrophes of 2008, the strength of the dollar has not abated. The confidence it shows in the continued economic growth of the country is reassuring; earnings growth is expected to coincide with the stronger US dollar. For US multinationals that sell products overseas, however, the strong US dollar makes these products more expensive and less competitive in the foreign marketplaces. Especially for Apple, which sells products that are already notoriously expensive, the potential impact of a strong dollar compared to international currencies smacks the bottom line.

In last quarter's earnings report, Apple's management spoke about foreign currency:

During the last two years, the U.S. dollar has appreciated by 15% over the basket of currencies where we do business. And we're a company that generates two thirds of our revenues outside the United States, 15% appreciation of the U.S. dollar. So on a year-over-year basis, just 2016 over 2015 was 340 bps impact from foreign exchange. This is something that we have offset almost entirely through a number of initiatives going from pricing actions to cost initiatives to our hedging program, but at some point, the strong dollar becomes the new normal and we need to work with that

This context is extremely helpful for investors so as to not view Apple in a vacuum. The FX impact has been real, and it seems as though management is running out of ways to mitigate the damage the strong dollar is wreaking on profits. How real is this problem?

the foreign exchange environment remains difficult, and we expect FX to be about $650 million headwind on a year-over-year basis into the December quarter."

That's over half a billion dollars getting blown up by the dollar.

Remember, however, that this strong currency dynamic cannot be understood myopically. A rising US dollar has coincided with the economic recovery, where millions of jobs have been recovered since the recession, wages have gone up, unemployment has gone down, and there seems to be no foreseeable calamity that will reverse the US economic fortunes.

So consumers have more money in their pockets, more disposable income, and in turn more opportunity to purchase Apple products and services. Consequently, although hundreds of millions are to be lost because of currency exchange, it is hard to predict how the underlying strength of the US economy is in turn bolstering Apple's sales as well.

Simple Moving Averages

Along with insider transactions, we believe SMAs have the potential to anticipate a stock move. Sometimes when the 50-day average falls below the 100-day average (a bearish crossover), a stock may trend down for some time to come as the average stock price is continuing downward. With Apple, however, we are focusing on a bullish crossover that occurred around October of last year, when the stock was at $108:

Since that time, Apple has moved higher as the results of the election and a report that was largely in-line with expectations. Today, with Apple over $120, we can see that the bullish crossover in August proved to precede a rise of around 10%.

Going forward, with the 50-day remaining above the 100-day, there is no indication from the moving averages that the momentum behind the stock shows any signs of fading. Notably, a bad earnings report can begin the bearish crossover process, so we are remaining vigilant on the price action.

Debt

Apple's debt has exploded. True enough, commenters will likely point out that it is has been a great time to take on debt, that Apple's cash position can buoy the debt load, and with rates low over the last few years, it was a fortuitous moment in time to do so. Still, Apple has $80bn in debt, which since 2012 is essentially an increase of $80bn. That's right, a few years ago, Apple had near-zero debt levels and now has a solid $80bn worth.

Another sobering fact: Apple added more debt than cash last quarter.

In the background, though, are the rumblings of a potential tax repatriation bill coming out of the Republican-led Congress and signed by President Trump. This could allow Apple to bring some cash home, pay off debt, reward shareholders, and get it all for a lower rate than expected. This no doubt is a reason we see a basically progressive CEO Tim Cook hold a fundraiser for Speaker of the House Paul Ryan. Chances are, Cook is hoping for some favorable legislation that can help Apple bring some of its cash and marketable securities back to the U.S.

Conclusion

The gloom of the US dollar will be hanging over Apple's earnings report. The stock remains higher as the momentum analysis indicated, with no signs of reversing. We are hopeful that management will continue to address these poignant issues and give investors answers as to what they are doing about it.

Valuing Apple Shares And How Much Higher They Can Go  Apple Inc. Launches Investigation Into An iPhone 7 Plus Explosion The Galaxy Note 7 horror is still fresh in most users  minds. Whenever there is a report of a smartphone explosion, it reminds people of Samsung s ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. On Wednesday, Brianna Olivas from Arizona tweeted a video of her rose gold iPhone 7 Plus bursting into flames. The video has been retweeted more than 24,000 time and has been viewed almost 1.3 million times, according to Mashable.

The iPhone 7 Plus  weird behavior started a day before explosion

The video shows the phone s case melting away and smoke emerging from one side of the device. Apple has launched an investigation into why the iPhone 7 Plus caught fire. Olivas also tweeted pictures of the smartphone taken after the explosion. Some Twitter users commented that the explosion might have been caused due to the liquid-filled iPhone case, though there is no evidence to support that theory, reports Mashable.

So my IPhone 7 plus blew up this morning ? was not even using it, literally no explanation for this pic.twitter.com/sQ8CJt4Y69   Bree? (@briannaolivas_) February 23, 2017

Brianna Olivas said her iPhone 7 Plus started showing signs of trouble a day before it exploded. The phone wouldn t turn on, so she took it to the Sprint store from where she had purchased the device in January. A Sprint employee got the handset to turn on. The employee ran diagnostic tests and found no problems at all with the iPhone 7 Plus, even though they said it  looked weird.  Anyway, the phone was working again.

Apple is in touch with the customer

Next morning, the device was charging next to Brianna s head. She told Mashable that she always uses the official Apple charger. Her boyfriend took it off of the charger and put it on the dresser. He went to the restroom. From there, he noticed from the corner of his eye that smoke was coming out of the phone. He also heard a  squealing noise.  By the time he reached over to the phone, it was already bursting into flames.

Brianna said her boyfriend threw the phone into the restroom, where it blew up and started spewing more smoke. She has since turned over the iPhone 7 Plus to Apple, which immediately issued a replacement device. An Apple representative said the company was running some tests, and results of the investigation are expected within a week. Apple is currently  in touch with the customer. 

Not the first instance of iPhone 7 explosion

Lithium-ion batteries that are used in smartphones are vulnerable to overheating and catching fire, especially if they are damaged or defective. Batteries could also catch fire due to a knockoff charger or faulty repair. Brianna said her phone was working perfectly fine until Tuesday when she had to take it to the Sprint store.

It s not the first time an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus has caught fire. In October last year, an iPhone 7 caught fire inside a man s car in Australia. Another iPhone 7 exploded in November in China after falling from just 50cm. Apple Inc director Albert Gore Jr sells 215,437 shares of co's common stock on Feb 22

Will Lawsuits Force Apple, Inc. To Prevent Texting And Driving? Distracted driving is a big and growing problem. In 2014, 3,179 Americans were killed in traffic accidents involving drivers diverting their attention to activities like eating, talking on their phone, or texting. It's the third most deadly factor in modern car accidents, behind only drunk driving and speeding.

You'll be delighted to hear that iPhone maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has patented a way to reduce this menace. But the patented solution is not yet implemented on any of Apple's devices.

What gives? Let's have a look.

What's new?

Last week, a survivor of a distracted-driving incident filed a class action lawsuit against Apple. The suit is not seeking a big payout from Cupertino. Instead, it calls for an injunction against sales of Apple devices in California until the company implements its patented prevention method against texting and driving on devices both new and already sold.

"If texting and driving is a vessel of trouble, Apple is the captain of the ship," the court filing states. "The company enjoys 40 percent of the smartphone market share -- far more than the nearest competitor. And its profits are enormous. Fortune Magazine reports that in the third quarter of 2016, Apple generated 91% of the smartphone market's profits, equating to a cool $8.5 billion in net profit -- or about $95 million in profit per day."

So the suit argues that Apple plays a significant part in the distracted driving problem, and has both a responsibility and the financial wherewithal to do something about it. Indeed, there is a tool on the table. The filing cites an Apple patent for disabling a mobile device when its motion sensors and other systems detect patterns consistent with driving a car. Filed in 2008, when the ancient iPhone 3G was brand new, and approved by the Patent Office in 2014, Apple has had an eye on this issue since the very beginning of its smartphone exploits.

But again, nearly three years after that patent got an official approval, the technology remains unused.

This lawsuit is not the first legal challenge to cite Apple's anti-distraction patent. It's just the first one that primarily wants to force Apple's hand into doing something with this allegedly life-saving technology. Others have been more concerned with cash payments for damage done by iPhone-wielding drivers.

Why isn't Apple using this patent yet?

Many fully granted patents never see the light of day in a real-world implementation. This particular one could be among those for a variety of good reasons. For example:

Apple could be working on a better solution than the one described in the '143 patent, but the new and improved solution isn't ready for a date with the Patent Office yet.

The company might have found flaws in its original technology, which was developed and filed at a time when smartphones were a poorly understood novelty. Real-world experience and deeper research could have changed Apple's design requirements in a hurry.

Other companies may have unveiled better solutions for the dangers of distracted driving, perhaps as part of efforts to come up with fully automated driving platforms. Nearly every major auto maker is on board with the autonomous driving trend now, alongside plenty of technology experts. I'd be surprised to learn that Apple's efforts from way back in 2008 provided a better solution than what all of Detroit and Silicon Valley could whip up nearly a decade later.

That's just scratching the surface of about a zillion reasons not to take a patented technology to market. I'm sure that Apple will come up with many more if the lawsuit ever hits a courtroom.

What's next?

No, I don't think that Apple will ever actually implement this particular deterrent to texting and driving. Lawsuits won't change that. Halting iPhone sales in California would be a powerful incentive, but Apple's top-shelf legal eagles can surely head that threat off at the pass. However, the fact that consumers are standing up to ask Apple for help with this conundrum could accelerate Apple's arrival at a more complete solution.

The company must balance the benefits of a life-saving safety feature against the risk that users might find the new restrictions too overbearing. If your phone came with opt-in restrictions on how you can use it in the driver's seat of a car, would you enable them? If not, you'd be part of the problem. Therefore, this is the kind of feature that needs to be forced on the user with no obvious way to turn it off. Otherwise, the change is not likely to make a difference.

Apple obviously doesn't want to push any of its loyal users over to Android and other platforms, where they can continue their risky behavior unfettered. Ideally, the smartphone industry would come together and push out protection against texting and driving. No fuss, no muss, and thousands of lives potentially saved. Top-down regulations would also do the trick, but that solution would also elicit pained groans of heavy-handed rules from every company in the mobile industry.

There may not be a real solution to the distracted driving problem until self-driving cars go mainstream. Until then, lawsuits and concerned users can only hope to turn Apple's smartphone designs in a safer direction.

Don't hold your breath.

Does This Apple, Inc. Stock Recovery Have Legs? Following a lackluster 2016 that saw Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just barely squeeze out some outperformance relative to the S&P 500, shares now seem to be recovering from the negativity. It's worth noting that Apple did spend much of last year underperforming the market, including the final months of the year. The Mac maker only pulled ahead in the last couple weeks. Shares are now trading in the ballpark of $120, levels not seen through all of 2016.

Investing is a forward-looking endeavor, so the real question is: Does this recovery have legs and will shares continue higher, or will shares gyrate lower and we're now just seeing the top of range-bound trading?

Why 2016 was so tough

Last year marked the first time that Apple posted year-over-year declines in iPhone unit sales, both on quarterly bases as well as for the full fiscal year. Considering the importance of the iPhone to Apple's financials, that's an incredibly tough storyline to beat. Apple investors in particular are known to be an emotional bunch, and investor sentiment is a function of emotion. It also didn't help that Apple Watch -- along with the broader smartwatch market -- is already suffering from weak demand and likely year-over-year declines in unit sales, too.

The skepticism only fueled the idea that Tim Cook's Apple can't innovate in the same way that Steve Jobs' Apple could. Just this week, a former Apple engineer argued that Cook changed "Apple from a dynamic change-maker into a boring operations company," among other critical comments about Apple's direction and ability to innovate.

I'd agree that Apple is a lot more boring these days, but I don't think focusing on operations is necessarily a bad thing. Execution and operations are intimately linked, and don't forget how nearly all of Apple's pertinent operating metrics -- including iPhone unit sales and revenue, among many others -- have skyrocketed under Cook's leadership. Those gains are more attributable to strong execution than revolutionary new products.

It's hard to see shares rising much from here

Don't get me wrong; I've long been the Fool's resident Apple perma-bull, and Apple remains one of my largest holdings. But in my opinion, it seems likely that Apple shares will remain range-bound and we may simply be near the top of that range. I've noted a significant disconnect between the buy-side and the sell-side, which I attribute to poor investor sentiment on the part of the buy-side. The sell-side has less skin in the game, and lofty price targets are often derived by using comparable peer valuation multiples.

If Apple stock is to really rise meaningfully from here, the company has to overcome the prevailing perception that it has lost its innovative touch, which would subsequently inspire investor confidence. Maybe then the market will price in higher valuation multiples. The problem is that disproving the skeptics takes a long time. And lacking any revolutionary breakthrough products in the short-term pipeline (i.e., in 2017), the company doesn't have many other ways to prove them wrong. Is This Apple Inc. iPhone 8 Rumor True? On Twitter, user Arkthub sent me a link to a forum post containing an interesting rumor about a key component inside of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 2017 smartphone lineup. The forum post, which appears to have originally shown up on website TheLayoff.com, essentially says the following:

Apple won't use Intel 's NASDAQ:INTC)

's Apple will instead use Qualcomm's NASDAQ:QCOM)

Although on the surface this rumor might seem reasonable, it doesn't quite make sense upon further thought.

The XMM 7560 probably won't be ready

Intel CEO Brian Krzanich has made it clear that the company intends to release new stand-alone cellular modems at an annual clip. Intel began shipping the 7360 during the second quarter of 2016, so it makes sense that the follow-on to 7360, which Intel calls the XMM 7480, will begin shipping in the second quarter of 2017 -- just in time for Apple's next-generation iPhone models (if Intel wins the spots, that is).

It seems very unlikely that Intel would have the follow-on to the XMM 7480, known as the XMM 7560, ready for commercial deployment in time for the iPhone 8 launch. After all, if the XMM 7560 were going to be all set for commercial deployments just a year after the XMM 7360 shipped, then wouldn't it make sense for Intel to just cancel the XMM 7480 altogether?

So, at the very least, this part of the rumor doesn't appear to be likely.

What modems will be inside of the next iPhone, then?

The following is pure speculation on my part -- there haven't been many leaks about the next-generation iPhones, particularly with respect to the individual components and suppliers thereof that will be in the phones.

However, key Apple supplier Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which supplies radio frequency (RF) and Wi-Fi connectivity components for Apple's iPhones, has indicated on several occasions that it expects to enjoy dollar-content increases in successive iPhone generations.

Increased RF content suggests enhanced wireless capabilities, which not only helps Broadcom's business, but also tells us that cellular modem upgrades are probably on the way.

The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus use either Intel's XMM 7360 or Qualcomm's Snapdragon X12   depending on the model. The Snapdragon X12 is more capable than the XMM 7360, but Apple appears to be artificially restricting the capabilities of the former to ensure parity of wireless specifications of both.

One hypothesis that I've put out there in the past is that Apple could deliver better wireless capabilities in its rumored OLED iPhone model compared to the capabilities found in the more mainstream models. In that case, I could see Apple using Qualcomm's Snapdragon X16 modem (i.e., gigabit-class LTE) in the OLED model, and then sticking with the X12 or using the Intel XMM 7480 in the other ones.

The X12 would, once again, need to be "sandbagged" to bring it to parity with the XMM 7480 (the X12 supports up to 600 megabits per second download speeds; the 7480 supports just 450 megabits per second).

We'll know more in about eight months when Apple formally unveils its next generation iPhone models. Is This What's Held Back Apple, Inc.'s Cellular Baseband Ambitions? "There is no stand-alone modem business anymore."

That's NVIDIA CEO Jen-Hsun Huang from a conference call way back in 2013, when the company was developing a Tegra mobile processor with an integrated baseband modem to challenge Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The baseband market had been shifting toward integrated solutions for years, and Qualcomm was by far the technological leader with integrated cellular connectivity. Integration provides significant benefits in costs and power efficiency relative to stand-alone modems.

Yet, here we are in 2017 and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is still using stand-alone baseband modems. The Mac maker had been exclusively sourcing modems from Qualcomm for about five years, and only recently added Intel to the mix as a second supplier. But over the years as Apple's own chip ambitions grew with its A-chips, this question has lingered: Why hasn't Apple integrated cellular connectivity into A-chips? We know the company places high value on power efficiency, which directly affects battery life.

The answer may potentially lie in the FTC's recent anticompetitive complaint (link opens PDF) against Qualcomm.

[Redacted] = Apple?

While the complaint has an entire section dedicated to Qualcomm's relationship with Apple, and all the ways Qualcomm leveraged its baseband supplier relationship to score exclusivity, the second charge is that Qualcomm consistently refused to license its standards-essential patents (SEPs) to competitors at fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory (FRAND) rates, contrary to its commitments.

For smartphone OEMs that it supplies basebands to, Qualcomm has incredible leverage since any disruption in baseband supply could cripple their ability to make mobile devices. But for competing suppliers where Qualcomm lacks that leverage, licensing SEPs enables competition. Things get a little murkier when you talk about vertically integrated companies that are both customers and competitors. Samsung comes to mind as a prominent customer of Qualcomm chips as well as a maker of applications processors and baseband processors.

Apple has long been a customer, and common sense suggests it should also have been interested in licensing Qualcomm's SEPs in order to integrate cellular connectivity into its own chips. Over the years, there's been tons of evidence that Apple is building its own wireless chips.

Naturally, Qualcomm wouldn't want to lose Apple's baseband business; did Qualcomm refuse to license its SEPs to the iPhone maker? What if Apple is the redacted company from this part of the complaint?

In breach of its FRAND commitments, at odds with its recognition that other industry participants "will require" a license to its FRAND-encumbered SEPs, and in tension with its practice of securing patent licenses for the benefit of its own customers, Qualcomm has consistently refused to license its SEPs to competing suppliers of baseband processors. Several of Qualcomm's former and current competitors, including Intel, [redacted], and Samsung, have sought SEP licenses from Qualcomm. In each instance, Qualcomm refused to grant a SEP license.

You might not consider Apple a competitor to Qualcomm, but it very much is, particularly as its chip engineering teams have ballooned in recent years. Apple designs many competing semiconductors, even if it doesn't sell them to other companies and just uses them in its own products. Qualcomm competes for Apple's business against Apple's own chip teams.

Refusing to license SEPs to Apple could be the perfect answer to the question that's been bothering me for years, since that would easily explain why Apple has yet to integrate cellular connectivity. Apple simply can't risk losing access to Qualcomm's modems, since the iPhone accounts for two-thirds of sales.

And it's not as if Apple could quickly ditch Qualcomm basebands in favor of its own A-chips with integrated cellular connectivity; it would take years for Apple to design and develop even after scoring a SEP license and it would need basebands in the interim. That's not a transition that Qualcomm would be supportive of, as granting Apple a SEP license would merely lay the foundation for Apple eventually ditching Qualcomm's basebands.

As a result, Apple has quietly endured Qualcomm's demands for the past five years. 5 Apple Inc. (AAPL) Chipmakers Trending Higher Despite Weak iPhone Sales Nearly 10 years ago, Steve Jobs took the stage at an Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) keynote event to introduce the first smartphone designed and built by the company. Little did he know that what he unveiled that day would grow to become the most popular consumer electronics product of all time.

Its popularity lifted financial performance to new heights for the next decade, making Apple the most profitable company in the world.

But the success of the iPhone doesn t solely revolve around Apple. In fact, many of its chip suppliers were put on the map as a result of the smartphone. These chipmakers heavily rely on iPhone sales, perhaps to a fault, to carry earnings growth on a quarterly basis.

The recent downturn consequently put a damper on sales metrics for Skyworks Solutions, Qorvo and Cirrus Logic while larger suppliers like Broadcom and Qualcomm effectively weathered the storm. With earnings season almost fully underway, Apple phone sales will once again come into focus.

More often than not, the chip companies provide a fairly clear signal of how phone sales will fare.

Broadcom Ltd (NASDAQ:AVGO)

Broadcom s exposure to Apple dropped considerably after agreeing to merge with Avago Technologies in mid 2015. The merged entity now generates about 15% of total revenue from Apple with exposure to China handsets, data centers, broadband and wireless jumping higher. Greater diversification helped offset any headwinds created by weak iPhone sales over the past year and a half. In fact, Broadcom delivered better than expected earnings and in line revenue for over 2 years and counting.

Analysts at Estimize believe the company s growing exposure to new technologies will drive financial performance moving forward. The consensus data is looking for $3.49 per share on the bottom line on $4.09 billion in revenue for the fiscal first quarter. This reflects a 37% increase in earnings with a 125% jump in sales from a year earlier.

Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS)

Skyworks kicks off its fiscal 2017 by looking beyond its two major customers, Apple and Samsung, to drive quarterly results. Moving ahead, the company will be looking to Internet of Things to complement its growing presence in mobile. Its latest IoT application released last week provides additional support to a leg of the company that makes up 25% of total revenue. Whether its autonomous vehicles, smart homes, or routers, Skyworks plays an important role as long as mobile connectivity is involved.

That said, earnings prospects remained relatively muted ahead of earnings season. The Estimize consensus is calling for $1.60 on the bottom line, about compared to the same period last year. Revenue for the period is forecasted to drop by 3% to $905.40 million, reflecting a slight improvement from the previous quarter.

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)

Intel recently won a significant portion of Apple s modem chip business for the newest iPhone 7 but that didn t come without controversy. Following the release of the phone many customers complained that Intel s chip lagged in performance compared to previous provider Qualcomm. The performance tests put the newly founded relationship in question, but recent news out of the Intel camp put those concerns to rest. At the annual Consumer Electronic Show this year Intel unveiled its first modem chip for smartphones that uses 5G technology. The new modem won t actually reach smartphones users until 2018 at the earliest but many reports suggest that progress has outpaced Qualcomm.

Beyond the push in mobile, Intel remains committed to expanding in automobiles, Internet of Things and other higher growth technologies while maintaining its dominance in CPU processors. For the upcoming quarter to be reported analysts at Estimize expect Intel to continue its winning streak, calling for a 4% increase on the bottom line and 6% on the top.

Qorvo Inc (NASDAQ:QRVO)

Qorvo s over-reliance on Apple iPhone s puts investors in a precarious position heading into earnings season. The new iPhone 7 came out of the gates hot, but new reports claim that sales were not as good as previously expected. As demand for the phone continues to fall, don t expect to see QRVO sales surge in the fourth quarter. Fortunately, like other Apple chipmakers, the company positioned itself into many other high growth markets such as 5G technology and Internet of Things. Revisions activity for the fourth quarter continue to edge down, making the stock s historical 5% decline during earnings season a realistic possibility.

Cirrus Logic, Inc. (NASDAQ:CRUS)

Shares of audio processor specialist, Cirrus Logic, doubled in value in 2016 despite a host of troubles concerning iPhone sales. Apple is hands down Cirrus s largest customer and currently accounts for two thirds of the company s total revenue. This number is down from previous years which is when Apple made up nearly 80% of revenue. Despite the phone s troubles, Cirrus Logic continues to crush analyst s estimates, showing the most promise of Apple s suppliers. Analyst s at Estimize are calling for earnings per share of $1.64 on $497.71 million in revenue, reflecting an 85% increase on the bottom line and 38% on the top.

Apple Repurchase Program - Positive Effects Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), will be releasing its 2017 fiscal Q1 earnings on Tuesday (January 31). Analysts and media are in the usual tug of war as to whether Apple is beginning a slow decline or is only in a pause in revenue growth. On Tuesday evening, we will find out this quarter's installment.

AAPL data by YCharts

One aspect of Apple management has been surprisingly controversial. That is the stock repurchase program. In last quarter's earnings conference call, CEO Tim Cook said:

We have now completed $186 billion of our current $250 billion capital return program, including $133 billion in share repurchases. [transcript]

Of course, Apple is not the only company to have repurchase programs. Other leaders in this are General Electric (NYSE:GE), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and drug maker AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV), but Apple's surpasses all in its size.

AAPL Stock Buybacks (Quarterly) data by YCharts

Criticism

Last July, fellow Seeking Alpha writer Antonio Carradinha, wrote an interesting and well thought-out piece criticizing Apple's share repurchase program.

When a company pursues a buyback, it is investing in itself and the firm's management surely thinks that there is no better business than that. All this is very misleading - notably in Apple's case - by the following reasons:

He then goes on to list six reasons.

What I agree with most is #6:

When a company repurchases shares to prevent or reverse undervaluation the advice to the market is that trading players for some reason are not supporting the supposed potential of the company.

Hopefully this is the case. So Apple directors believe that the current price undervalues either:

the current real value of the company, or the future value given plans that it alone knows about.

Or both.

The question then is whether or not it is deluding itself.

Carradinha notes that:

1. While spending billions of dollars with the sole purpose to reduce the number of shares of the company its price has been going down over the last 15 months. 2. With the share buyback Apple has aimed to improve earnings per share which is not happening.

There are two errors here. The first is that somehow repurchases must improve EPS.

This disregards the historical context of Apple's revenue situation.

For several years, Apple ignored a move by many customers to purchase larger smartphones that were offered by competitors. Apple continued to grow in this period, but eventually saw the writing on the wall, and in September of 2014, it released the 6 Plus model. This led to a huge uptick in sales, as customers who had been waiting for such a larger model jumped in to buy it (40% YoY increase and more for the first two quarters). Even at that time, it was suggested that Apple would have trouble meeting these sales numbers in the years to come, and this prediction turned out to be true.

But there were a couple of reasons for the subsequent retreat in iPhone sales. First was the huge surge in sales of iPhone 6 model. Second, this was compounded by a historic slowdown in smartphone growth. In years past, Apple saw year-over-year growth of much higher than 40%, but the market was expanding so quickly that it did not pose a problem to continued growth. Now, however, this is not the case, as the total smartphone market nears saturation, and calendar-year 2016 saw negative growth for Apple.

Revenue drop

Another negative historical factor is the rise of the U.S. dollar. This has had an additional, and substantial, negative effect on revenues and earnings.

My point here is that if Apple's share price is down, it has little to do with the repurchase program, and any positive effects of the program have been grossly overshadowed by the negative factors just mentioned.

Personally, I believe that the market has frequently been overly zealous in emphasizing the negative when it comes to Apple. From the early, pre-iPod days up to now, there are many reporters and analysts who have a prejudice against anything Apple.

Current situation

Currently, Apple shares have risen above $120. While this is short of the $135 high in April of 2015, it is still a 52-week high. It is also over 30% higher than the $90s range of April 2012 when the repurchase program was initiated, and more than twice the April and June 2013 lows of under $60.

Clearly, buybacks in the latter time frames were excellent investments for shareholders!

Logical Flaw

We need to return to Carradinha's first point noted above to see a fundamental flaw in his reasoning:

1. While spending billions of dollars with the sole purpose to reduce the number of shares of the company its price has been going down over the last 15 months. [true at the time]

The implication here is that the purpose of the buyback is to boost share price.

This Carradinha states yet more clearly here:

When a company repurchases shares to prevent or reverse undervaluation 

While boosting share price is a potential and desired outcome, all else being equal, it is not the primary purpose of repurchases.

The real purpose is simple

Corporations generate cash (hopefully), and Apple has generated lots. Steve Jobs held these earnings for a long time because he did not want to find Apple cash-strapped as it had been in earlier days. Additionally, Apple has used cash as a strategic weapon to help suppliers build capacity for cutting edge technology, thus securing assured capacity, unique capacity, and more favorable pricing.

But since then, Apple's available cash has reached such an enormous size that returning it to investors was the only reasonable choice. I am sure that today, Jobs would also be in favor of the current plans.

There are basically two ways to return capital to investors; dividends and share repurchase. Retirees like the extra income from dividends, but many investors would rather not have to pay the income tax on dividends. They like to see the intrinsic value go up, without having a tax burden. Apple's program strikes a balance using both.

Repurchase effect

The buybacks have had one very real impact on the company's financial results. It is very measurable.

Just look at the number of shares in Calendar Q3 (September) 2012 and the latest quarter (December 2016). (Shares and EPS for 2012 are split adjusted)

The question is this: What would EPS have been if there had been no buyback? The math is simple. EPS is simply the profit divided by the number of shares outstanding. If we assume that there were still 6.6 billion shares in the December quarter,

then the EPS would have been only $1.36

the current value is 23% higher.

If you think we have trouble with a low share price, what do you think it would be if last quarter's EPS had been only $1.36? If the trailing twelve-month EPS had been 20% less, and, all other things being equal, the share price would be under $100.

Now you might argue that the price is not affected because while the larger EPS drives it up, Apple now has less saved cash. The reality, however, is that the share price never really reflected cash on hand. Over the last several years, if you subtracted cash per share from the stock price and then computed a P/E ratio, you would always come up with some absurdly low value.

(Note: These numbers are estimate as I have used the number of shares on date of earnings announcement, not the actual number of shares repurchased which is not so easily available. This number is likely to be slightly higher than what I have used, since there are other factors that may affect the number of shares, such as employee options plans, etc.)

Conclusion

There may be other reasons that Apple's stock repurchase program is bad for the company and shareholders. Still, while not an end-all, share repurchases do have two valuable purposes:

Return earnings to owners without incurring taxes, and Increase the EPS for a given earnings.

Obviously, this cannot increase net earnings overall. If revenue and earnings go down substantially, then a reduced number of shares will not cure the business problems.

However, as we have seen, this already has improved EPS by more than 20% over what it would have been. It should be noted that this is a gift that keeps giving, as this 20+% will go on forever.

There may indeed be other effects, and some may be negative. However, it is not realistic to deny the positive effect repurchases have.

Apple: The Tough Race To $1 Trillion  
2017-02-22
Intel Corporation's 5G Apple Inc. iPhone Opportunity Microprocessor giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) surprised many when it was revealed that it had won a significant portion of the cellular modem orders for Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 7 series smartphones.

The company's public commentary suggests that this isn't just a proverbial flash in the pan, either -- Intel seems to have the iPhone 8 (or whatever Apple calls the follow-on devices to this year's iPhone 7 series) as well as the follow-on to that in the bag.

In this article, I'd like to go over why I think there's an opportunity for Intel to gain dollar content share at Apple with the 2018 iPhone.

The shift to 5G

Both Intel and wireless chip giant Qualcomm both intend to sample 5G modems in 2017 with commercial shipments beginning in 2018.

To my knowledge, both companies' 5G modem solutions will require separate 4G LTE modems (either as discrete parts or integrated in the smartphone applications processor) for phones implementing the 5G solution to work on today's 4G networks.

Apple was late to adopt LTE relative to some of its peers in the smartphone market, but given that Apple has "grown up" quite a bit from a technical perspective (substantially higher research and development budget) and the industry has gotten much more competitive (forcing Apple to try to adopt cutting-edge technology for its devices), it may be one of the first to deploy 5G modems.

Intel's opportunity

Should Apple choose to adopt 5G functionality in its 2018 iPhone models, this could be a solid win for Intel's cellular modem business.

Indeed, if Intel goes from selling a single LTE baseband (and associated components) to selling both an LTE baseband as well as a 5G modem (and any additional components), then it makes sense that the chipmaker's dollar content per iPhone could increase.

Given that Intel's only significant exposure to the large smartphone chip market is via the sale of cellular modems to Apple, a big boost in dollar content at Apple should mean a big boost in the revenue -- and ultimately profits -- that Intel can harvest from the smartphone market.

A big step for Intel's modem business, a small step for Intel in total

Intel is an extremely large company, generating nearly $60 billion in revenue during 2016. Intel's revenue run rate from sales of modems to Apple is likely in the ballpark of $1 billion per year (assume $10 per modem, 100 million iPhone units with Intel modems sold per year).

If Intel were to see its dollar content rise by 50%, then roughly $1 billion in annual sales becomes $1.5 billion; a doubling of dollar content would mean that $1 billion in annual sales goes up to $2 billion.

Of course, Intel is already investing significantly to develop these cellular modems, so the more revenue that the company can wring out of those investments, the better. However, any potential revenue growth from additional dollar content in a future iPhone isn't going to be a game changer for Intel stock.

To put things into perspective, though, few things have the potential to move the needle for Intel stock -- what the company needs to do (and has been doing) is looking to capitalize on as many reasonably sized opportunities as possible in the hopes that, in aggregate, they add up to enough additional revenue to deliver revenue growth even as its largest business (personal computer processors) declines. Why Is Apple Really Going Up? Since then, the shares have rocketed by an eye-popping 52.84%, making it one of the best performing stocks in the entire market.

It is coming off a prolonged correction that took the shares down a heart-stopping 31.53% until March 2016.

Yesterday, the share price of Steve Jobs' creation touched a new all-time high of $134.50, giving it an eye-popping market capitalization of over $704 billion.

Are happy days here again? Has a new dotcom type bubble ensued?

That is highly unlikely. The reasons for the ballistic move are far more complex.

Think of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock as a call option on peace with China. When post-election fears that the company's highly globalized business model was doomed, the shares tanked. Since then, a curious thing has happened.

While the 2016 presidential campaign saw China attacked on a daily basis, there has been barely a peep since November 8th. In fact, the new president claimed to have a very friendly telephone call with Chinese president Xi Jinping only last week.

So does globalization live? Was its promised unwind yet another broken campaign promise?

The stock market certainly thinks so. This possibility was enough to punch Apple stock to an all-time high, several days in a row.

Instead, the target has been Mexico, with which the US is threatening total economic collapse.

Apple's business model is at risk on many fronts. While Apple's iPhones are designed in the US by foreigners, like Johnny Ives, they are made in China.

So any restriction on trade of any sort between the two nations would have dire consequences for Apple's bottom line. Punitive US import duties would reduce sales. Strife of any kind would make Apple facilities in China a big fat target for retaliation.

A rising share price says NONE of this is going to happen.

This is only the latest campaign promise that has thankfully been broken. China will be labeled a currency manipulator on day one . . . NOT. Japan will be called out as an unfair trader . . . NOT.

The administration is slowly figuring out that the agricultural states will, far and away, be the biggest losers in any future trade conflict, every one of which voted for the president. So the whole trade war thing may just quietly go away.

The market LOVES that idea.

And there ARE announced administration policies that would be hugely beneficial for Apple and will almost certainly be implemented. Who better to profit from a corporate tax cut than the world's most profitable company?

Who benefits the most from the repatriation of foreign profits than the planet's biggest owner of such a wad, some $250 billion worth. These funds will almost certainly be used to increase Apple share buybacks and increase dividends.

Kaching!! Longer term, I love Apple.

I believe it could hit $1 trillion in market capitalization sometime in 2018, or 2019 at the latest. That will probably occur in the run-up to a new biannual generation iPhone launch.

The only disappointment will be that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will probably get there first.

Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Could Apple Inc. (AAPL) Be The First Ever $1 Trillion Company? I stumbled across a prediction last week that would impress even Mad Money s Jim Cramer.

According to a recent report from Oxfam, an international charitable organization, Bill Gates has a shot at becoming the world s first trillionaire. Oxfam speculates that if the returns on the tech mogul s $75 billion fortune in the next 25 years are similar to those in the last 25 years, Gates has a shot at jumping the $1 trillion mark.

That got me thinking, if one man has a shot at becoming a trillionaire, certainly one of the S&P 500 s biggest companies has a shot at becoming the world s first $1 trillion company?

Turns out, a few do.

I see five S&P 500 companies with a shot at breaking the $1 trillion mark in the next five years.

  Facebook Inc ( FB ) is the smallest company on the list with a market cap of $386 billion. Facebook s share price would need to hit $345, up 159%.

 Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ) has a market cap of $400 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,980, up 125%.

 Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) has a market cap of $498 billion. Shares would need to hit $130, up 100%.

 Alphabet Inc ( GOOG ) is currently worth $570 billion. Shares would need to hit $1,431, up 70%.

I believe every one of these companies will eventually be worth $1 trillion. However, one other company will beat them all to it.

Thanks to a variety of factors, Apple Inc. ( AAPL ) is set to become the first $1 trillion company in the world in the next five years.

The company has been on a roll. After beating fourth-quarter earnings by 4%, shares just hit a new all-time high above $135.

That gives Apple a market cap of $710 billion, making it the largest company in the S&P 500. It has also placed Apple within striking distance of the $1 trillion mark. Shares of Apple would only need to climb 50% to $200 to give it a market cap of $1 trillion.

That is well within reach.

If its current valuation stayed the same, Apple would need to grow earnings by 8% annually in the next five years to hit that target. As it stands, Apple is expected to grow earnings by 8% this year and another 13% in 2018. Those two years alone get Apple almost half way to 50% earnings growth.

But even if Apple s earnings grow slower than expected, it has an ace up its sleeve.

Next Page Yield Issues Force Apple Inc. To Ditch Curved Display On iPhone 8 [REPORT] Apple s 10th-anniversary smartphone is certainly the most anticipated device of 2017. The intense hype around the so-called iPhone 8 has pushed Apple and Foxconn shares to a record high. Until recently, there were rumors that the iPhone 8 would feature a curved OLED display. In fact, Apple was testing curved screens for the 10th anniversary iPhone. But the company has dropped the idea, according to a new report.

iPhone 8 to feature a 2.5D glass

Supply chain sources familiar with the matter told Chinese research firm TrendForce that Apple is finally making the switch from LCD to OLED panels. But the display won t wrap around the sides. The iPhone 8 would have the same 2.5D flat glass as the iPhone 7. Apple rejected the curved display due to low production yields and poor drop-test results.

Confirming previous reports, TrendForce said Apple would get rid of the physical home button to make room for more screen. Despite its 5.8-inch display, the iPhone 8 would be the same size as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7, thanks to extremely thin bezels. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo recently told investors that the Touch ID fingerprint sensor would be replaced by a  function area  at the bottom of the screen. It would bring down the actual active display area to 5.15-inch.

iPhone 8 coming in 64GB and 256GB storage options

Sources told TrendForce that the iPhone 8 would come with two different storage options: 64GB and 256GB. The current iPhone 7 has base storage of only 32GB. With rising quality of photos and videos, 32GB may not be sufficient for most users. But limiting the choice to only 64GB and 256GB could significantly increase the cost of the phone.

The iPhone 8 is said to have 3GB RAM, the same as the current iPhone 7 Plus. TrendForce added that the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus would have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens as their predecessors. The iterative upgrades would pack 2GB and 3GB RAM, respectively. Also, they will ship in the same storage options as the current flagship models.

Apple to produce 40 million iPhone 8 units in 2017

Corroborating recent rumors, TrendForce reports that the 10th anniversary iPhone would cost $1,000 or  even higher.  It is unclear whether both the 64GB and 256GB would be priced above $1,000 or only one of them. New features such as the 3D laser sensor, OLED display, wireless charging, and improved waterproofing would push up the production cost of the device. The research firm points out that the iPhone 7S would be more competitively priced as Apple seeks to  make significant differentiation  between the 4.7-inch handset and the other two models.

Sources told TrendForce that Apple was planning to produce 100 million units of the next-gen iPhones by the end of 2017. Of that, 40 million units will be the 10th anniversary iPhone 8. Overall, the company is estimated to sell 230 million iPhones this year. Apple says new Apple Park campus to be ready for occupation in April

Apple Inc. Is Advancing Its Own Mac Chips To Reduce Intel's Role [REPORT] Apple is always in the news for something, and this time it is being reported that the company is making its own chips for use in its Mac laptops. Apple s chips will reportedly improve the battery life of its devices, according to Bloomberg.

Not replacing Intel chips

The chip is designed to perform some basic tasks such as checking emails and installing updates even when the computer is asleep. Currently, these tasks are under the control of the MacBook s main processor. By building a low-power processor, the iPhone maker will remove the dependency on its core and also reduce battery consumption, notes The Verge.

Supposedly, the chip will be similar to the Apple-made processor that is already used inside the MacBook Pros to manage the Touch Bar. This seems to suggest that Apple hasn t undertaken some bold initiative such as replacing the Intel processor at the core of every MacBook with an Apple-designed ARM processor, such as the ones used in iPhones and iPads, notes The Verge.

Citing sources, Bloomberg also said that abandoning the use of Intel chips in its laptops and desktops is not something Apple is planning in the near future. Apple is likely planning to continue augmenting the Mac with ARM processors, helping it access the benefits of both types of chip.

Apple aims to improve battery life

Apple is planning to release an upgraded MacBook Pro later this year, and the chip may debut the same time, said Bloomberg. It will be a good fit, as the company has already been receiving complaints about the poor battery life of its 13-inch MacBook with Touch Bar. The chip might help extend the battery life.

However, whether or not it will prove helpful to people who regularly leave their MacBook on battery power for long durations, cannot be said for now. The benefit, it seems, can only be reaped when the laptop is in sleep mode. So it might be possible that Apple is making an effort to improve the standby time of its computers  more so than how long they lasts during a day s use,  says The Verge.

Apple will be able to more tightly integrate its hardware and software functions by building its own chips. Also it will be able to control some of the cost of components for its devices. Since a low-power mode already exists in the Macs, the iPhone maker may not even highlight the advancement whenever it releases a product with its new chip inside.

Apple, Inc. Earnings: Can the Tech Giant Live Up to a Higher Stock Price? Mark your calendar. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has just set the date for its second-quarter results. On May 2, investors will get a timely glimpse into the company's recent performance.

With Apple stock hitting new highs ahead of the earnings release, can the tech company live up to higher expectations from investors? Here are some key areas to watch when Apple reports its Q2 earnings early next month.

Will iPhone sales continue upward?

After three quarters in a row of declining iPhone sales, the segment's revenue finally turned upward in the company's most recent quarter. iPhone unit sales and iPhone revenue were up 5% year over year in Apple's first quarter of fiscal 2017. Going into Apple's second quarter, investors will be looking for a similar trend in iPhone sales.

Based on Apple's guidance for second-quarter revenue to be between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion, management is likely expecting year-over-year growth in iPhone sales to persist during the quarter. This guidance implies overall revenue of about 3.4%, using the midpoint of Apple's guidance range, compared to Apple's $50.6 billion in revenue in the year-ago quarter. Considering that the iPhone accounted for 64% of Apple's trailing-12-month revenue, Apple's iPhone sales are a major determinant of the direction of the company's overall revenue, and thus a key determinant in management's guidance.

It's time for a dividend increase

Apple is expected to give investors an update on its capital return program alongside its second-quarter earnings release, as management has done in previous years. With the program consisting of both Apple's dividend and its share repurchase authorization, investors should look for management to update investors on both.

As for Apple's dividend, investors should look for a dividend increase in the range of 8% to 15% -- in line with the company's dividend increases in the past four years.

Perhaps even more important than Apple's dividend increase will be management's plans for share repurchases. Historically, Apple has opted to give more weight to share repurchases than dividends.

Indeed, since the company initiated its dividend in 2012, Apple has spent $144 billion buying back its own shares and $51 billion paying dividends. However, with Apple stock rising about 25% in the past 12 months, it's possible that management will choose to give more emphasis to dividends than it has in the past.

Looking ahead

Another key area investors won't want to miss is Apple's guidance for its third quarter of fiscal 2017. With Apple only recently returning to revenue growth, the company's ability to grow its business is still in the spotlight.

Apple's third quarter will be particularly interesting because, while Apple's iPhone 7 is still fairly new, the smartphone's overall form factor is several years old, dating back to the company's iPhone 6 launch in 2014. Will an aging iPhone design continue to drive growth for Apple? Further, investors will be looking to see if Apple's rapidly growing services segment can grow to represent an even larger portion of sales and, in turn, help Apple's overall revenue.

Based on how successful the iPhone 7 has been so far, and on the company's success with growing its services revenue, investors should expect Apple to guide for yet another quarter of year-over-year growth.

Apple reports its second-quarter results after market close on May 2 and will host a live quarterly conference call to discuss results with analysts at 5:00 p.m. PST. Apple Inc.'s iPhone 7 Display Compares Favorably With Samsung Galaxy S8's Raymond Soneira, a leading display expert, recently published his tests of the display found on the Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) Galaxy S8. Soneira says the Galaxy S8 "becomes the best performing smartphone display, earning DisplayMate's highest ever A+ grade."

Although the display is quite impressive and looks gorgeous in person, digging deeper into DisplayMate's test results for the S8's display, as well as its tests of the iPhone 7's display, reveals that the display found on Apple's six-month-old flagship can hold its own with Samsung's best in several important ways.

The many ways the iPhone 7 display beats out the Galaxy S8's

There are many ways the display found on the iPhone 7 handily beats out the one found on the Galaxy S8.

First, the iPhone display is brighter. Soneira's measures the peak brightness of the Galaxy S8's display when the screen is completely white at 405 nits, while at 50% average picture level and 1% full screen white, the S8's display achieves 460 nits and 565 nits, respectively.

These are solid results, but the iPhone 7 achieves peak brightness of 602 nits -- that's without automatic brightness -- no matter the content. This is one of the advantages of LCDs: Peak brightness doesn't depend on the content as it does with OLEDs.

It's worth noting that with automatic brightness, the iPhone 7's display achieves peak brightness of 705 nits, while the S8's display can hit between 575 nits and 1020 nits.

Beyond brightness, the iPhone display appears to be quite a bit more color accurate. For example, the average color error within the DCI-P3 color gamut on the S8's display is 2.7, with the largest color error being 5.9. In contrast, the iPhone 7 display manages an average color error of just 1.0 under the DCI-P3 color gamut, with the maximum error coming in at 2.6.

That's not all, though. Soneira's tests show that the iPhone 7's display achieves an average gamma of 2.21, which he says is "excellent" and "very close to 2.20 standard." The S8's display, on the other hand, achieves an average gamma of 2.36, which Soneira says is "very good" but "slightly too high."

As far as viewing angles are concerned, the iPhone 7's display seems to have the Galaxy S8's beaten out. In terms of white point color shift, the iPhone 7 achieves a 0.8 JNCD (that stands for "just noticeable color difference"), and as far as primary color shifts and color shifts for "color mixtures" goes, the iPhone 7's display achieves JNCD values of 1.5 and 2.1, respectively.

The S8's display, on the other hand, sees a white point, primary color, and color mixture shifts of 1.8, 4.8, and 3.2, respectively. These figures are "excellent," "very good," and "very good," respectively, according to Soneira, but the iPhone clearly delivers better results.

The S8 is probably a "better" display, but Apple deserves credit

Apple appears to have built truly excellent displays for its iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and in several ways, those displays are -- according to DisplayMate's tests -- better than even Samsung's shiny new displays.

Nevertheless, Samsung's S8 display has many advantages of its own, including the infinite contrast ratio afforded to it by being OLED based, as well as the attractive curved, full-face design with minimal bezel.

In terms of what is likely to really catch consumers' eyes, the S8's display is obviously much more interesting than the ones found on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, credit where it's due -- Apple built some extremely fine displays for its current flagships that, objectively, still hold their own many months after launch.

The same couldn't really be said about the displays found on Apple's iPhone 6 or iPhone 6s series of smartphones, which to me signals a fundamental improvement in Apple's competitive positioning with respect to display performance and quality. Time to Sell Apple Innovation and valuation   Apple Inc. AAPL   Macpro imac

I have been back and forth on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) many times in this blog. One constant theme, however, has been that the company needs to innovate aggressively on all fronts. With the stock price at record highs and, in my view, innovation at a low point, the risk-return trade off from owning the stock has turned markedly negative.

Apple finally did come clean today and admit that the company dropped the ball on the MacPro, but not until more than three years had passed. During those three years, the company basically deserted the high-end creative users who relied on Macs and sang their praises. Though not as long in the tooth as the MacPro, the iMac is long overdue for a major upgrade. Microsoft s new Surface Studio far surpasses the iMac. That s right Microsoft is making better more innovative computers than Apple! Even the new Mac books, though beautiful computers, did not break much new ground and Microsoft is gaining in that space too with its Surface Books and Tablets.

iPad innovation has also slowed. The only innovative feature of the model that was introduced last month was the price.

You might say,  who cares,  Apple makes most of its money on the iPhone. But the iPhone is a computer. In my opinion, all the products fit together and make up a  computer culture.  That culture should lead to innovation on all fronts. At Apple that no longer appears to be the case. Apple Inc. Censoring China-Critical Satire Show in Hong Kong and Taiwan China Uncensored, a New York-based comedy channel that satirizes Chinese politics, society, and international relations, has been removed from Apple TV s app store in Hong Kong and Taiwan as well as mainland China despite the former two regions enjoying political autonomy from Beijing.

Running about a dozen episodes a month and hosted by California native Chris Chappell, China Uncensored is distributed by NTD Television, a  non-profit television station founded by Chinese Americans to be an alternative voice to China s state-run propaganda media,  as described in a press release.

NTD Television is part of Epoch Media Group, which The Epoch Times is also part of.

China Uncensored has about 400,000 YouTube subscribers, primarily in North America, but also claims a significant and growing following in the Asia-Pacific region. Its style is often likened to American political comedy shows like The Daily Show or The Colbert Report.

The five-year-old channel has covered many sensitive facets of the Chinese Communist Party, such as its foreign espionage, its suppression of dissidents, and its persecution of religious and ethnic minorities.

Now the world s biggest company, Apple Inc. sells a greater number of iPhones in China than any other country. It is not clear if Apple blocked China Uncensored in Hong Kong and Taiwan to further mollify the communist authorities of whom the show is often critical or if the move comes as a blanket coverage of regions claimed as Chinese sovereign territory.

 Is Apple so scared of the Chinese Communist Party that it would censor China Uncensored in Hong Kong and Taiwan, just in case?  asked Chappell in a video.  Or is Apple just confused about which places belong to China and this was all an accident? They should probably consult a lawyer, like we ve done. 

China Uncensored has launched a petition asking viewers to call on Apple to restore the show to the Apple TV app store in Hong Kong and Taiwan. 1 Obvious Way Apple Inc. Is Leaving Money on the Table Later this year, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is expected to launch its much-rumored premium iPhone with an OLED display. The phone itself, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, is expected to fit in a physical footprint like that of today's 4.7-inch iPhone. The cool part, though, is that Apple is reportedly going to fit a full 5.8-inch OLED display in that footprint.

Now, Kuo says that not all that 5.8 inches of the display will be what he refers to as "active display area." Indeed, a sizable portion of the display will be dedicated to what he refers to as an "area for functions (e.g., allocation of virtual buttons),"leaving just 5.2 inches of active display area.

Image source: Apple.

This all sounds good, and I think the phone has the potential to do quite well in the marketplace, even at a relatively high price compared with the "standard" iPhone models. However, I can't help thinking there's one obvious omission from Apple's upcoming product lineup.

Where's the big OLED iPhone?

When Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) announced its Galaxy S8 series of devices, it rolled out two models. The first, known as the Galaxy S8, features a 5.8-inch full-face OLED display. This model, Samsung says, will sell for $720.

Samsung also offers a higher-end variant, called the Galaxy S8+, which includes a larger 6.2-inch full-face OLED display. The company charges $840 for this one -- a hefty $120 premium.

Apple is expected to charge north of $1,000 for the upcoming OLED iPhone, and to be blunt, I think the company will still see robust demand for the device in that price range. However, I can't help thinking Apple is leaving money on the table by not planning a larger option alongside the 5.8-inch option -- say, 6.2 inches.

Such a device could command a premium over the "standard" OLED iPhone and, with the right additional features, could be a strong seller. The ultimate impact from the introduction of such a product would be a richer product mix with higher iPhone average selling prices and potentially higher total profits, too.

Maybe that'll be next cycle's trick

What Apple could potentially do is save such a larger premium iPhone for its next product cycle. After all, once this year's OLED iPhone hits, Apple will need to come up with ways to make next year's products compelling enough to spur iPhone upgrades and capture more premium smartphone share.

Going forward, I could see Apple releasing not one, two, or even three new smartphones per year, but at least four: the two "standard" iPhone models -- the successors to the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus -- and two "premium" iPhone models.

Apple could conceivably endow such a larger premium iPhone variant with even more features than it can fit in the bill of materials of the smaller premium iPhone. Such a device would certainly be quite expensive -- at least as smartphones go, anyway -- but I suspect a large segment of the iPhone buying population would be willing to pay more just to have the very best features and technologies.

After all, that's the thinking behind this year's OLED iPhone, right?

New Apple Watch will reportedly launch in the second half of 2017 Apple is reportedly gearing up to launch a new Apple Watch, presumably the Apple Watch Series 3, during the second half of this year.

DigiTimes, which keeps its ear close to the ground within the tech giant's supply chain, said Wednesday that Chinese company Compal Electronics will start to shoulder some of the Apple Watch Series 2 manufacturing, which is currently built entirely by Quanta Computer, also in China. Compal reportedly decided to help manufacture Apple Watch units after a decline in demand for laptop computer manufacturing.

The report suggests that Quanta Computer will continue to handle manufacturing of Apple's new Apple Watch Series 3, which DigiTimes said will launch during the second half of this year.

DigiTimes can be hit or miss when it comes to supply chain rumors, but the second half release of an Apple Watch Series 3 makes sense.

Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 2 in September 2016 and Apple typically launches new products on an annual cycle. We're expecting Apple's new iPhones in September and, given the Apple Watch's status as a primary iPhone accessory, it wouldn't be out of the question for Apple to introduce the device side by side.

It did that last year when it unveiled the Apple Watch Series 2 and the iPhone 7, after all. The Technical Chart For Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Speaking Volumes Apple Inc. (AAPL) is now trading with a very clear set of technicals. Taken together they paint a very compelling picture of how investors and traders should be approaching AAPL. Traders who rely only on fundamentals do themselves a great disservice, often missing out on the better upside inherent in a stock. This is why technical charts are important.

AAPL s most recent trading session saw the stock achieve a high of $144.89 and a low of $143.17. The high in the most recent session compares favorably to the established 52-week high of $144.50 which was set by AAPL on 04/04/17. The recent low represents a +61.81% since 05/12/16 which is a good sign for traders looking to capitalize on the stock s upside. The current trading pattern for the stock is very telling when one looks at the overall sentiment of analysts. Presently there is a target price of $146.49 set for AAPL, a figure which is below the most recent high set by the stock. The stock also has a beta of 1.17. Since the beta is greater than 1, it can be interpreted that the stock is theoretically more volatile than the market   something traders will surely be keeping an eye on.

More robust technical indicators are now starting to emerge for the stock and these are very helpful for traders looking to make a strong assessment of the stock s upside. Both the Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures have come into play for AAPL. Based on current readings for AAPL, the 14-day RSI is 74.53%. This suggests that AAPL is Currently overbought and may have peaked, creating a chance for a price reversal. The stochastic reading is also very revealing based on current readings. In this case, AAPL has a stochastic reading of 92.15%. This suggests AAPL is overbought at current levels. AAPL also paints a compelling picture via its 50 and 200 SMAs. AAPL, based on the current trend can be considered bullish. This sentiment has created an attitude towards the stock which can be reasonably said to be positive.

Traders can bolster their view of a stock s upside by taking a keen look at other technicals in support of the ones explored above. AAPL s +5.25 has created a positive sentiment when measured over the past 30 days. AAPL has outperformed the S&P 500 by 20.48. This, has concluded initially, has created higher volatility levels when compared to other stocks in the same sector. Historical volatility for AAPL is showing a reading of 11.05%. AAPL also presents with an Average True Range reading of 1.07. AAPL has demonstrated through its technical indicators, the sentiment of the markets towards its upside. These signals should be taken seriously by traders who have an interest in the stock.

Can Apple Inc. Charge Over $1000 for Its OLED iPhone 8? In a recent note (by way of MacRumors), analyst Steve Milunovich with UBS said that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) tends to price its devices "quite competitively." He therefore thinks that Apple isn't likely to "stray far from the price point of Samsung's (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF) most expensive [smartphone] model at $840-$850," with its upcoming premium OLED iPhone 8.

He further goes on to say that although the variant of the OLED iPhone with 256 GB of storage could run customers between $950 and $1,000, the entry-level version should come in at "only" between $850 and $900.

Although I get the point that Milunovich is making here, I'm not convinced that the company will price its upcoming flagship device so "cheaply."

This is supposed to be the ultimate iPhone

Apple has built great smartphones for years, but it has been fundamentally limited in what kinds of technologies that it can bring to market with each new device. Apple sells phones in quantities that other smartphone vendors can only dream of, and it enjoys per-device gross profit margins that dwarf those of many competitors.

Those are fundamentally good things, but they're also pretty limiting -- Apple needs to be sure that it builds phones that can be manufactured in extremely high volumes while simultaneously being manufactured with low-enough cost structures that it can maintain its desired high margins at the price points that it sells its phones.

Those restrictions certainly limit what Apple can afford to include in its devices.

By moving the price up with the premium iPhone -- and, to be clear, a move to $1,000 for the base model would be a significant step up -- Apple gains breathing room in the bill-of-materials cost. What this means is that it can build a fundamentally more expensive phone, but the idea is that those cost adders make for a much more attractive phone and that Apple can successfully charge a nice premium for it.

I think Apple wants to build what is essentially the ultimate iPhone and, in fact, the ultimate smartphone without worrying too much about potential cost constraints.

Justifying $1,000-plus pricing

I suspect that Apple will limit this premium iPhone to 128 GB and 256 GB storage configurations -- just as it did with the jet black iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. I also think that $1,000 for the 128 GB model and $1,150 for the 256 GB model could be reasonable price points given the potential level of innovation that this product may deliver.

Indeed, if Apple keeps the pricing of its standard iPhone models the same as they are currently, then $1,000 for a hypothetical 128 GB premium iPhone would represent just a $131 premium over the hypothetical 128 GB iPhone 7s Plus.

That $131 would, if the rumors are to be believed, buy the user quite a lot. The OLED display would improve the viewing experience on the device, the form factor is likely to be much more convenient, the device sleeker looking, and the addition of 3D sensing capabilities could enable interesting new usage models, too.

I think $1,000-plus pricing for the premium OLED iPhone 8, assuming that the device turns out to be fully loaded with intriguing new features and a phenomenal aesthetic, would be more than fair. Report: Apple Inc.'s Premium OLED iPhone 8 Could Be Delayed DigiTimes, citing a report from Economic Daily News, says evidence is mounting that Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) upcoming premium OLED iPhone 8 might not launch in September. Instead, thanks to "technical issues related to the lamination process of curved OLED panels," as well as "the adoption of a 3D sensing system," could cause the new phones to arrive in either October or November.

DigiTimes further goes on to note, once again citing the Economic Daily News report, that "market sources" are keeping an eye out for "the pull-in for passive components from the iPhone's supply chain to see whether production of the new devices is on track."

What if the new iPhone is delayed?

Given that the upcoming OLED iPhone is seemingly shaping up to be a technical tour de force, it's probably not too far-fetched to believe that the new device could be delayed. After all, the new technology Apple is bringing to this device is clearly difficult to build, and considering the demand that Apple is reportedly expecting for this new model, Apple probably isn't going to want to launch this new device until it can prepare a lot of them for initial shipment.

The bad news -- if the launch of the new device is delayed -- is that Apple clearly won't begin recognizing revenue for its newest phones as early as it has in previous years. That could make year-over-year comparisons a bit messy.

Remember, Apple tends to ship some next-generation iPhone models at the end of the fourth quarter of a given fiscal year, with most of the initial sales rush happening in the first quarter of the following fiscal year.

If the launch of the iPhone 8 is pushed out into, say, October, then the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year might come in a little lighter than many expect, but then the first quarter of the following fiscal year could be more robust than what one would typically expect.

Things could get quite messy, though, if Apple doesn't launch the new OLED iPhone until sometime in November. Not only would initial revenue that would have been recognized at the tail end of the current fiscal year be pushed out, but a substantial amount of revenue that would have been recognized in the first quarter of the following fiscal year, typically Apple's peak quarter, would be pushed out, too.

That could really mess with Apple's seasonal revenue trends.

Moreover, if Apple is late to getting its new OLED iPhone out, then that could lead potential buyers of the new phone to opt for alternative devices with, perhaps, similar feature sets.

What Apple needs to do

If Apple won't be able to ship the new OLED iPhone in serious quantities until October or November, it should still announce it and take pre-orders for it when the other iPhone models -- presumably called the iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus -- go up for sale.

Taking pre-orders probably wouldn't change the dynamics of any revenue push out, but it could serve to stem any potential order losses to competing devices resulting from the push-out, and it would help prevent potential customers from just buying one of the cheaper iPhone models, negatively affecting Apple's product mix.

Delays aren't ideal, but in this case they wouldn't be the end of the world. Building state-of-the-art devices in mass quantities isn't easy, but as long as the company has a killer product on its hands and as long as it lets customers pre-order it ahead of mass availability, everything should work out all right.

SYDNEY Australia's consumer watchdog has sued Apple Inc (AAPL.O) alleging it used a software update to disable iPhones which had cracked screens fixed by third parties.

The U.S. technology giant "bricked" - or disabled with a software update - hundreds of smartphones and tablet devices, and then refused to unlock them on the grounds that customers had had the devices serviced by non-Apple repairers, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said in a court filing.

"Consumer guarantee rights under the Australian Consumer Law exist independently of any manufacturer's warranty and are not extinguished simply because a consumer has goods repaired by a third party," ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said in a statement.

An Apple spokeswoman did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment.

The regulator said that between September 2014 and February 2016, Apple customers who downloaded software updates then connected their devices to their computers received a message saying the device "could not be restored and the device had stopped functioning".

Customers then asked Apple to fix their devices, only to be told by the company that "no Apple entity ... was required to, or would, provide a remedy" for free, the documents added.

Apple engaged in "misleading or deceptive conduct and made false or misleading representations to consumers" about its software updates and customers' rights to have their products repaired by the company, the commission said.

As well as fines, the ACCC said it was seeking injunctions, declarations, compliance program orders, corrective notices, and costs.

The lawsuit was filed late on Wednesday, a week after the consumer watchdog granted Apple a win by denying Australia's banks the right to introduce a mobile payment system to rival its Apple Wallet.

(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates) Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) New iPhone Gimmicks Could Be a Magnet for Gross Margin ... Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set up to make a grand splash with its most elaborately high-tech production yet: the iPhone 8. Maxim looks ahead to the exciting capabilities of the new iPhone, but highlights concerns that with jazzed up elements come gross margin pressure risks. For the analyst, Apple s upcoming iPhone launch boils down to a question of gimmick versus material cost increases- and time will tell if he continues to stay bullish on the stock. Meanwhile, how good do Netflix, Inc. s (NASDAQ:NFLX) international prospects look? Following Piper Jaffray s international survey testing the waters for NFLX s potential to expand its worldwide mark, to put it simply: very. Let s take a closer look:

Apple s Tricky Tango Between Gadgetry and Elevated Material Costs

Though Maxim analyst Nehal Chokshi expects Apple s long-term dance into Augmented Reality to be compelling as the iPhone 8 tacks on fancy new features, he keeps a watchful eye on gross margin pressure along the way. While new iPhone gadgetry is enticing, for the analyst, these facilities also translate to higher material costs.

Nonetheless, while the analyst anticipates the new features for wireless charging and augmented reality forthcoming with the iPhone launch  to be largely gimmicky  and prospectively risk GM pressure, he reiterates a Buy rating on shares of AAPL with a $163 price target, which represents a 13% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

iPhone GM initially took a step back from fiscal 2009 s 60.2% to 44.8% by fiscal 2016. However, based upon the tech giant s fiscal first quarter print for 2017, GM looks to be  on track  to hit 41.9% for the year. iPhone GM certainly has waned in a course of eight years, but the analyst finds GM to be  relatively steady  at 40%.

Chokshi notes,  With each new iPhone generation, AAPL has had a strong history of implementing new capabilities that have required an increasing bill of materials cost, despite a relatively consistent ASP of ~$650 [ ]  Anticipating that should buzz spring to reality of rumored wireless charging and augmented reality features, between a $5 to $10 cost addition each for the electromagnetic receiver chipset coupled with the laser-meet-receiver depth detection module, the analyst projects Bill of Materials to approximate a $20 rise.

Overall,  Given the potential multiple moving parts, we are not revising our estimates, especially as we intend to commission a new consumer survey to understand the magnitude of unit growth for the iPhone 8 cycle as well as whether the year thereafter will sustain a third year of consecutive unit growth for the iPhone. We also expect the Augmented Reality industry event we are hosting on May 5 will provide greater visibility into the technology, competitive landscape, capabilities and cost of implementing Augmented Reality componentry within the next gen iPhone,  Chokshi surmises.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, four-star analyst Nehal Chokshi is ranked #574 out of 4,553 analysts. Chokshi has a 63% success rate and realizes 15.6% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, Chokshi yields 31.1% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics indicate AAPL as a Buy. Out of 37 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 28 are bullish on Apple stock, 7 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of 6%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $152.90.

Netflix: International Subs Are Looking Good Long-Term

Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson is out with a bullish call on Netflix after surveying close to 1,000 internet households spanning across 7 global markets that have on average had the option to use the online video streaming giant s services the past four years.

Believing the international survey results further bolster his conviction that not only can the giant s penetration meet the analyst s 2020 expectations, he anticipates Netflix could outclass his projections. Therefore, the analyst reiterates an Overweight rating on NFLX with a price target of $166, which represents a just under 16% increase from where the shares last closed.

Of the survey respondents spanning the globe, 37% are already subscribing to the giant s platform, with 13% anticipating to hop on board later in the year.  Given Netflix will have been in all countries (excl. China) for four years by 2020, we have increased confidence in the company s ability to achieve, or potentially exceed, our estimate for 12.5% international (excl. China) internet HH penetration by 2020,  asserts Olson, who believes that volatility circling subscriptions  comes with the territory,  but advises investors to  expect favorable ongoing LT trend[s]  moving forward.

Olson opines,  The most recent quarter s results provided evidence that concentrating on quarter-byquarter nuances in the numbers (such as churn issues caused by un-grandfathering in 2016) can mask an otherwise positive trend. Simply put, Netflix is the leader in a category that contains very sizable growth potential. There will likely be increasing competition and hiccups in results along the way, but we think Netflix has reached  escape velocity.'  Though Netflix may see competitors join along the way, the analyst does not see this as threatening to the giant s prospects, as  the market should support multiple large players  on back of a gradual transition from the old days of broadcasting to new emphasis on internet delivery.

 Netflix spent 2016 building a global footprint, which included launches in 130 countries (everywhere other than China and a few immaterial markets),  concludes the analyst, who notes that while 2016 gravitated not meaningfully ahead of a break-even margin, the years to come should translate as  highly profitable  for the giant, with international contribution margins not only catching up to the US after 2020, but potentially even beating its performance.

As usual, we like to include the analyst s track record when reporting on new analyst notes to give a perspective on the effect it has on stock performance. According to TipRanks, five-star analyst Michael Olson is ranked #119 out of 4,553 analysts. Olson has a 65% success rate and garners 13.5% in his yearly returns. When recommending NFLX, Olson gains 8.3% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics show NFLX as a Buy. Based on 35 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 22 rate a Buy on Netflix stock, 12 maintain a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell. The 12-month average price target stands at $154.97, marking a nearly 8% upside from where the stock is currently trading. Buffett Hasn't Embraced Tech Stocks - He Has Embraced Massive Share Repurchase ... For decades Warren Buffett told us that he wasn't smart enough to invest in technology stocks, that technology stocks were beyond his circle of competence.

Now look at him. Mr. Buffett is closing in on 90 years old and what is he buying? Technology stocks of course.

Take a look at the largest Berkshire Hathaway stock holdings as listed in the recently released annual letter:

Focus in on the cost column, which details the amount Berkshire has invested in each company. The company with the most cash invested (original cost) into it is International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM) with $13.8 billion. That is weird.

IBM would be thought of as a technology company. It get weider when you notice the $6.7 billion that Berkshire has invested in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL)

as of December 31, 2016.

Then in an interview with CNBC following the release of the annual shareholder letter Buffett made these comments about the size of Berkshire's Apple investment:

"But we would have, one of the fellows in the office has about 10 million shares, and I have for Berkshire's account about 123 million. So, we got about 133 million shares."

Since the end of 2016 Berkshire's Apple position has grown from 61 million shares to 133 million shares, which as I write this would be worth $18.6 billion. We can't tell for certain what the actual purchase price paid for Apple was subsequent to year-end, but it looks like the two biggest equity investments that Berkshire has are in IBM and Apple.

I bet you could have gotten pretty good odds 10 years ago that you would never live to see that!

What Is Going On Here?

In the previously linked CNBC article Buffett was asked why he now was willing to risk so much money on technology companies when he was so legendary for avoiding them. Here was his answer:

I mean, obviously [Apple is] very, very, very tech-involved, but it's a consumer product to a great extent too. And I mean, it has consumer aspects to it. And one of the great books on investing, which I've touted before, is one that Phil Fisher wrote back around 1960 or thereabouts, called 'Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits.' It had an effect on me.

I went out to meet Phil Fisher after reading the book, I found him in this little office in San Francisco. And I recommend any investor read that book. And it's still in print. And he talks about something called the scuttlebutt method, which made a big impression on me at the time.

But I used it a lot, which is essentially going out and finding out as much as you can about how people feel about the products that they...it's just asking questions, basically. And Apple strikes me as having quite a sticky product and enormously useful product that people would use, and not that I do.... And I don't know what goes on inside their research labs or anything of the sort. I do know what goes on in their customers' minds because I spend a lot of time talking to 'em.

If I'm understanding him right, it seems that Buffett feels that Apple's consumer brand is strong enough to withstand technological challenges from competition. He admits that he has no insight into what goes on in Apple's research labs, which isn't surprising. He simply believes that consumers will stay loyal to Apple even if competition is able to develop somewhat better products. He does also admit that the company is still very, very tech involved though.

I Think There Is More To The Story Here

OK, I can appreciate how much consumers love the Apple products. However, I think that the real key thing behind both the IBM purchase and the Apple purchase is what these companies are doing with their capital allocation policies. They are both buying back boatloads of shares every year. I don't think it is a coincidence that they are both doing this and that Buffett owns both companies.

First let's take a look at Apple. I went to the company's SEC filings and dug out the amount of shares repurchased in dollar terms over the past few years. Here is what I found:

2016 Apple Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $30 billion

2015 Apple Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $35 billion

2014 Apple Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $45 billion

Wow, that is a lot of money. Here is what those repurchases have done to Apple's share count

\

The share count is plummeting.

Now IBM. I also went to IBM's SEC filings and dug out the share repurchase information:

2016 IBM Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $3.5 billion

2015 IBM Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $4.6 billion

2014 IBM Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $13.7 billion

2013 IBM Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $13.9 billion

2012 IBM Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $12.0 billion

2011 IBM Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $15.0 billion

2010 IBM Dollar Amount Of Share Repurchases - $15.4 billion

I went back further on IBM because that provides the picture that Buffett was looking at when he was buying IBM shares. I think we all would agree at this point that the IBM investment has gone quite the way he expected, but I think this provides some insight into what he was attracted to at the time of purchase. Here is the IBM share count over time:

IBM Shares Outstanding data by YCharts

I'm not sure what the blips in the graph are, but clearly IBM has massively reduced its share count over time.

Buffett needs to invest in very large companies. It is very hard to find large companies that can offer much in terms of growth, but companies like Apple and IBM that are shrinking their share count can give a boost to growth per share.

I believe that the shrinking share count of these two companies is a big reason for why Buffett bought so much of them. The number of companies large enough for Buffett to invest in is small. It makes sense that he would make some concessions on his technology dislike for the earnings boost that these share repurchases provide.

Candlesticks

A black body occurred (because prices closed lower than they opened).

During the past 10 bars, there have been 4 white candles and 6 black candles for a net of 2 black candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 29 white candles and 21 black candles for a net of 8 white candles.

A long upper shadow occurred. This is typically a bearish signal (particularly when it occurs near a high price level, at resistance level, or when the security is overbought).

A spinning top occurred (a spinning top is a candle with a small real body). Spinning tops identify a session in which there is little price action (as defined by the difference between the open and the close). During a rally or near new highs, a spinning top can be a sign that prices are losing momentum and the bulls may be in trouble.

Momentum Indicators

Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.

Stochastic Oscillator

One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 71.2546. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 69.08. This is not a topping or bottoming area. However, the RSI just crossed below 70 from a topping formation. This is a bearish sign. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago.

Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 93. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago.

MACD

The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a sell 0 period(s) ago.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), with its ROE of 34.7 over the past 12 months, performed better than the industry, which averaged 24.34% in the same period. However, investors, focused only on Return on Equity, often ignore the rising interest costs which result in actual return to be significantly lower. Thus, we must look at how a company s debt profile changed during the same time period. Check out our latest analysis for Apple

Breaking down Return on Equity

ROE ratio basically calculates the net income as a percentage of total capital committed by shareholders, namely shareholders  equity.While an ROE ratio of more than 15% would draw any investor s attention, historically, established companies in the developed countries have delivered an ROE between 10% and 12%.

Return on Equity = Net Profit   Shareholders Equity

ROE above the cost of equity estimate indicates value creation, which apparently is the only reason shares rally. The cost of equity can be estimated through a popular and Nobel-prize winning method called Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). With a few sets of assumptions, the CAPM pegs AAPL s cost of equity at 9.35%, compared to its ROE of 34.7%.





ROE can be broken down into three ratios using the Dupont formula. The profit margin is the income as a percentage of sales, while asset turnover highlights how efficiently a company is using the resources at its disposal. Increased leverage, primarily through raising debt, is good for a profitable company, but only to the extent it doesn t make the firm insolvent in a time of crisis.

Dupont Formula ROE = annual net profit   shareholders  equity ROE = (annual net profit   sales)   (sales   assets)   (assets   shareholders  equity) ROE = profit margin   asset turnover   financial leverage

A trend of profit growing faster than revenue is indicative of improvement in ROE. While investors should assess the past correlation between them, an assessment of the analysts  profit and revenue forecast points to the most likely scenario going forward.The asset turnover for a capital intensive industry such as bricks-and-mortar retail would be substantially lower than the e-commerce retail industry. A comparison with the industry can be drawn through ROA, which represents earnings as a percentage of assets. Apple s ROA stood at 11.9% in the past year, compared to the industry s 9.06%.

We can assess whether AAPL is fuelling ROE by excessively raising debt or it has a balanced capital structure by looking at the historic debt-equity trend of the company. While Apple s debt to equity ratio currently stands at 0.66, investors should assess how it has changed over the past few years. To account for leverage, we should look at AAPL s Return on capital, which stood at 25% in the past year versus industry s 6.64%. ROC is earnings as a percentage of overall employed capital compared to just equity as in the case of ROE.

ROE   It s not just another ratio

On the surface, ROE appears to be a simple profitability ratio indicating the return an investor should expect. However, for a sound investment consideration, it should still appear good when a company s debt profile, profit-revenue trend, and leverage are considered.

Not This Year Apple Promises Mac Pro Redesign Is Coming, Just Not This Year

First, the good news: Apple announced plans to release a completely redesigned version of the Mac Pro. Now the bad news: you won t see it until at least 2018. But professional Mac users can sleep soundly in the knowledge that Apple understands their frustrations.

Why else would the company invite a group of reporters to its headquarters yesterday to update the world on a product it doesn t plan to release for at least another year? Apple seems to understand that it has a major perception problem when it comes to professional users, and can't afford to ignore the issue until an official product announcement sometime in 2018.

Not Built for Modern Workloads

The current version of the Mac Pro was released in 2013. At the time, the company thought it was making a bold statement with the unusual form factor that looked more like a cylindrical Bluetooth speaker than a professional desktop machine. But instead of representing a great leap forward for the company s pro users, the current incarnation of the Mac Pro is now closer to a dead end.

A large part of that is likely the fault of the internal architecture, the company admitted to reporters yesterday. Apple designers had gambled on an architectural plan designed to accommodate two smaller GPUs (graphics processing units), rather than a single larger one. Not necessarily a bad idea in principal, but that wasn t how the industry evolved.

Instead, designs and workloads have moved toward relying on one larger GPU. Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi acknowledged to reporters that the current design was inadequate for professional users whose workloads depended on running on a single GPU or single-threaded CPU (central processing unit) performance. Certain scientific workloads require a single GPU, and heavy 3D graphics or VR applications can also be taxing for two smaller GPUs, Federighi said.

A Move to Modular

However, the Mac Pro s architecture made it difficult for the company to reconfigure the machine along the lines that their customers required. In particular, while the desktop s triple chassis design was well-equipped to disperse the heat generated by two lower-power graphics chips, it couldn t handle the thermal output generated by a single, massive GPU.

That left Apple with a device that didn't serve the needs of many of its professional customers. Apple was also unable to upgrade future versions while remaining true to the original design. As a result, the Mac Pro has received little in the way of significant upgrades to its specifications. After four years on the market, the Pro has now fallen dramatically behind its competitors in the professional space.

But Apple said that it's already hard at work on redesigning the Mac Pro. Although the company did not reveal any major details, executives did say the next model will be much more modular than the current version to better facilitate future upgrades. The new modular architecture will also include a new Pro display, something Apple has shied away from in the past.

Without Apple Inc., Imagination Technologies' PowerVR Has No Future At this point, anybody with even a cursory interest in technology stocks has probably heard that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently informed graphics specialist Imagination Technologies (NASDAQOTH:IGNMF) that it would no longer need to use its graphics intellectual property in future mobile applications processors.

For those unfamiliar with Imagination, it is a small silicon intellectual property vendor that produces graphics and processor core that it licenses to companies that design and build their own chips. Imagination typically receives an up-front licensing fee for its intellectual property coupled with ongoing royalties for each chip containing its intellectual property sold.

Imagination has historically depended heavily on Apple for the bulk of its revenue (just over 50% in fiscal year 2016). However, it's worth observing that this figure understates just how important Apple was to Imagination's PowerVR graphics business.

Digging into the numbers

In fiscal year 2016, Imagination reported that total revenue from what it defines as "continuing operations" came in at 120 million pounds (about $149 million).

Of that revenue, 17.1 million pounds (about $21 million) of it came from licensing revenue while 102.7 million pounds (about $128 million) came from royalty revenue.

Now, it's also worth noting that Imagination doesn't just sell graphics intellectual property. Several years back, Imagination bought MIPS Technologies in 2012 for $60 million. This acquisition added CPU intellectual properties to Imagination's portfolio, and it has been licensing MIPS processor technology since.

According to Imagination's annual report, the company enjoyed 6.44 million pounds ($8 million) in MIPS licensing revenue and 23.47 million pounds (approx. $30 million) in MIPS royalty revenue in its most recent fiscal year. PowerVR licensing was 10.16 million pounds (about $12.62 million) and royalty revenues were 77.7 million pounds (roughly $96.5 million).

In Imagination's disclosure vis-a-vis Apple, the former said that in fiscal year 2016, PowerVR licensing and royalties from Apple totaled 60.7 million pounds (about $76 million) in revenue.

Apple doesn't license Imagination's MIPS processor cores for its chips; its interest in Imagination's portfolio is solely in its PowerVR portfolio. What this means, then, is that Apple made up nearly 70% of Imagination's PowerVR graphics revenue in the company's prior fiscal year.

Without Apple, PowerVR has no future

If Imagination can't work out some sort of serious technology/patent licensing arrangement with Apple, then it is extremely unlikely that the former will be able to continue to fund the development of its PowerVR graphics technology.

Of course, there's the possibility that Imagination could find new, large customers for its technology, but that's not going to be easy. With Apple out of the picture, that's roughly 15% of the total addressable market in smartphones gone.

Furthermore, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is the largest smartphone applications processor vendor, capturing about 42% market share in 2015, per Strategy Analytics (2016 numbers should be a bit different, but you get the gist). Qualcomm builds its own graphics processors and is therefore not a potential customer of Imagination's graphics tech.

We're already at half of the mobile applications processor market out of Imagination's reach.

Companies like Spreadtrum, MediaTek, Huawei, Samsung (NASDAQOTH:SSNLF), and Xiaomi (merchant vendors as well as smartphone companies that build their own mobile processors) could be reasonable targets for Imagination's PowerVR tech, but these companies have been largely using graphics technology from ARM Holdings.

It's going to be hard for Imagination to capture share from ARM Holdings going forward for several reasons. The first is that Imagination couldn't beat ARM here even with technology that was arguably much superior; ARM's graphics technology has gotten much better over the years and should only get better with time as ARM has the wherewithal to invest much more in such technologies than Imagination can.

Even stripping away the technology argument, Imagination's future -- now that Apple is about to walk out the door -- is now uncertain. ARM's future, on the other hand, is rather certain (and quite bright). On that basis alone, it will be hard for Imagination to keep its existing non-Apple customers, let alone wrest away share from ARM.

The point is this: Without Apple, Imagination's PowerVR technology likely has no future in Imagination's hands. A Bearish Warning For Apple Back in November 2015, I wrote about why Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stood at over 25% of my total portfolio (25% Allocation to Apple - Too Much Risk?). Seventeen months later, and a 22% gain (ex-dividends), I will now try make a case for why investors should be wary of holding shares in the company over the near future and why I am strongly considering reducing my exposure to the company.

Here is a snippet of my proposition in that previous article.

What has changed?

Fast forward to today, and the picture for Apple has changed significantly. The stock has outperformed the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) index by nearly 10% (ex-dividends) over this timeframe. However, this has not happened in a straight upwards trend. The shares continued its decline to a low of $90 by May 2016. Since then, it has propelled 61% to the highs of today.

Back in November 2015, Apple shares were at a P/E ratio of 13, while the S&P 500 stood at 22. This represented a discount of 41% to the wider market. Now Apple commands a P/E ratio of 17.21 with the index at 26.44. On face value, the index seems too expensive to ignore, while Apple seems to be sitting at what I might consider fair value. However, when digging deeper, various valuation metrics suggest that Apple is soon due for a correction.

Valuation Metrics

No matter what valuation metric you use, Apple looks expensive compared to where it has traded over the past 5 years.

As we can see from the charts above, Apple is nearing or has exceeded its 5-year highs on these three common valuation metrics.

Another way I try to get a perspective of valuation is to look at what are the limits of dividend yield to which investors are prepared to accept from a company for what they pay for the shares. Apple reintroduced its dividend in the second half of 2012. It later increased the dividend by 15% after 3 quarters. I believe that to use the dividend yield as a tool to aid in valuation, the dividend needs to become normalized, thus, why I only take into account the dividend yield history from mid-2013. As can be seen, the dividend yield is approaching its "normalized" lows to which investors are prepared to accept for the price of the shares.

I should note that it is expected that Apple should raise the dividend payments on the next earnings release later this month. Using the last few years as a guide, the dividend should be raised by approximately 10%. This will, therefore, push the yield further away from historical lows.

These historically-stretched valuations support is what I have seen from wider investors. Not much can go wrong for Apple right now. Bearish articles have become a rarity, and investors are all hyped-up about the upcoming iPhone, so much so that it has been dubbed "the super-cycle" phone. Out of curiosity, I wanted to see the psychology of the market at significant highs and lows over the last 5 years.

What can be seen is that times of great investor excitement generally have been closely followed by deep upset through a sharp fall in the share price, and vice versa. This always reminds me of the famous Warren Buffett quote:

Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.

Where do things stand now?

While I do believe that the stock is teetering on historical valuation highs, I don't think the run-up has run out of steam. We still have to wait for a few things. Investors are likely to await the results of the upcoming quarterly report in which we expect a dividend increase, but more importantly, they await the news of Trump's plans for foreign earnings repatriation. Only then will I look to reduce the percentage weighting of Apple in my personal portfolio.

Conclusion

Apple shares have had a strong rally from the lows seen in May 2016. The shares' valuation looks stretched by most common valuation metrics; however, several reasons remain why the rally is not finished.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Apple Inc. Stock Will Correct Ahead of Q2 Earnings (AAPL) It s time to face the music. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL ) is overbought. In fact, shares have traded north of their 14-week relative-strength index (RSI) since the beginning of February   after the company s last quarterly earnings report. And with the next trip to the earnings confessional just around the corner, AAPL stock needs to shed some weight or be faced with an even steeper post-earnings selloff.

Apple stock has been in rally mode for some time, but the uptrend is getting long in the tooth. The diamond of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Apple has outperformed all other blue chips in the index so far in 2017, gaining more than 22% since the beginning of the year. But shares have stalled in recent months, battling with $140 throughout most of March, and now staring up at $145 in April.

What s more, Apple s 10-day and 20-day moving averages have finally caught up with the shares, but are only providing moderate price support at best. A break below these trendlines could be all the catalyst short-term traders need to take some profits off the table, potentially sending AAPL down for a test of $140 or even $138 ahead of May s quarterly earnings report.

Sentiment is also showing signs of fatigue.

Apple options traders on Friday were less than enthusiastic despite the leak of new iMac features. Granted, the iMac isn t the iPhone, but that hasn t stopped AAPL speculators before. In fact,

Apple s May put/call open interest ratio has risen in the past couple of weeks to perch at 1.03, as puts are added at a faster rate than calls among near-term options traders. Furthermore, more than 32,000 puts have accumulated at the out-of-the-money $135 strike, potentially indicating lowered expectations for Apple stock.

Even short sellers are getting in on the act, which is an unusual development for AAPL stock. During the most recent reporting period, the number of Apple shares sold short rose by 4% to 52.9 million. While this accumulation still represents only about 1% of AAPL s total float, the rise itself is notable on a stock that typically sees overwhelmingly bullish sentiment.

Finally, the brokerage community remains heavily bullish, as usual   and this could be a bad thing for Apple stock.

Next Page Teens Continue to Back Apple Inc. (AAPL) as Device Brand Leader, Intel ... Between teens showing rising loyalties to being a part of the enticing Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) brand and solid momentum for Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) that has the chip maker in great standing for the first quarter of the year, analysts are out making bullish cases for these tech players. Piper Jaffray has Apple in the lead two teen surveys running, anticipating the tech giant s cool ranking will strengthen all the more following the release of the iPhone X. Meanwhile, one of Wall Street s top analysts spotlights a three-part stable PC performance, iPhone s modem ramp, and 3-D NAND advantage as cause to expect a stellar 2017 for the chip maker. Let s take a closer look:

Teens Say Apple s Branding Reigns as Hippest of Them All

Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Olson continues to highlight Apple s strong position as a device brand leader, particularly among the teen demographic, for two surveys running. After polling over 5,500 teens, the analyst found the best results yet for Apple, with 76% indicating they proudly are part of the iPhone base and 81% believing their next smart phone purchase could very well be an Apple one.

With the results for the tech giant proved even more favorable than Olson s last survey during the fall of 2016 and more teens raring to join the Apple ecosystem, the analyst predicts  further upside,  and subsequently reiterates an Overweight rating on shares of AAPL with a $155 price target, which represents a just under 8% increase from where the stock is currently trading.

Not only does Apple s  iPhone [maintain a] strong lead among teens,  but the giant s Apple Watch continues to rule the roost as the #1 smartwatch for teens. While 84% of teens in the analyst s survey noted they do not own any smart watches, Apple captured 11% of respondents, a significant step up compared to Samsung Gear as next in line at 2%.

Moreover, Olson forecasts an advantageous risk/reward heading into the fall launch for the hyped iPhone X, elaborating,  With a solid December quarter in the rear-view mirror, if Apple meets March quarter estimates, we think AAPL shares are positioned to continue to run into the Fall  17 launch of the 10th anniversary device. Our expectation is for AAPL to continue to meet/ beat 1H iPhone estimates, based to some degree on relatively easy comps. 

 Overall, we view the Teen Survey data as a sign that Apple s place as the dominant device brand among teens remains intact,  concludes Olson.

According to TipRanks, which measures analysts  and bloggers  success rate based on how their calls perform, five-star analyst Michael Olson is ranked #117 out of 4,560 analysts. Olson has a 65% success rate and earns 13.7% in his annual returns. When recommending AAPL, Olson yields 14.2% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics exhibit AAPL as a Buy. Out of 38 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 29 are bullish on Apple stock, 7 remain sidelined, and 2 are bearish on the stock. With a return potential of nearly 7%, the stock s consensus target price stands at $152.87.

Intel Poised for Success: Stability in PCs, Data Center, and the iPhone Factor

Top analyst Vijay Rakesh at Mizuho previews Intel ahead of its first quarter earnings for 2017 with a fair amount of confidence in the chip maker, reiterating a Buy rating on INTC with a $42 price target, which represents a just under 17% increase from where the shares last closed.

Anticipating that on the heels of a robust second half of 2016, Intel stands to potentially outperform considering the chip backdrop this time of year.  After a strong 2H16 in PCs, we believe MarQ/JunQ PCs remain stable to better than seasonal. We believe while the PC market remains stable and a tailwind, the focus will be on Data Center (DCG), a 2H iPhone modem ramp and 3DNAND ramp,  Rakesh highlights.

For the first quarter of 2017, Rakesh projects revenue to hit $14.4 billion, EPS to reach $0.65, and GM to land at 62.6%, which largely mirrors consensus modeling 3% dips quarter-over-quarter. For non-GAAP, the analyst looks for the chip maker to bring in $14.8 billion in revenue and $0.65 in EPS, closely matching consensus expectations of $14.8 billion in revenue and $0.56 in EPS. For the financial year of 2017, the analyst sets expectations for $60.3 billion in total non-GAAP revenue as well as $2.80 in non-GAAP EPS, compared to GAAP estimates of $60.3 billion in revenue and $2.50 in EPS. Forecasting the financial year of 2018, the analyst estimates INTC will generate $61.9 billion in revenue and $2.90 in EPS, and GAAP estimates of $61.9 billion in revenue with $2.70 in EPS.

 We believe ODM PC strength is being driven off better U.S corporate PC demand, continued gaming/VR strength with JunQ industry PC shipments potentially trending flat q/q, and ODMs noting DRAM pricing trending up into JunQ,  continues the analyst.

Meanwhile, with Conservative Data Center (DCG) expectations scaled from a 10% to 12% year-over-year climb to a  more conservative  high single digit %  y/y growth,  the analyst believes this  sets up better for investors.  Consensus presently models an 8% year-over-year rise and Rakesh looks for 7% year-over-year growth. Additionally, the analyst notes,  While we believe DecQ Xeon Phi for Deep Learning, grew ~50% q/q, it is still <5% of DCG. We believe NVDA could dominate DL/AI data center market into 2018E. 

Ultimately, Rakesh braces for a  2H17 with iPhone 8 wireless modem builds and 3D-NAND,  surmising,  We believe with our expectations of ~120M iPhone 8 builds and INTC potentially getting at least 50% or more of the builds, it could be a topline tailwind with ~$7-10 ASPs. Also, 3D-NAND, while a margin drag, could help the topline in 2H17. 

Vijay Rakesh has a very good TipRanks score with a 72% success rate and a high ranking of #31 out of 4,560 analysts. Rakesh realizes 28.9% in his yearly returns. When recommending INTC, Rakesh gains 10.1% in average profits on the stock.

TipRanks analytics demonstrate INTC as a Buy. Based on 30 analysts polled by TipRanks in the last 3 months, 16 rate a Buy on Intel stock, 12 maintain a Hold, while 2 issue on the stock. The 12-month average price target stands at $40.68, marking a nearly 13% from where the stock is currently trading.

Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Rumors about the specs for the latest Apple iMac hit the Street on Friday, but AAPL stock options traders showed little interest.

The biggest shocker among the list provided from MacRumors was that Apple was moving away from Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ) Core i7 chips and into Intel Xeon E3 chips   a move that analysts speculate will allow new iMac to take advantage of ECC (error correcting code) memory utilized by more professional and business model desktop PCs.

It s unusual for AAPL stock to not be moved by product rumors, and even more so for options traders to essentially  sigh.  Total volume on AAPL on Friday was respectable at 733,000 contracts, but puts and calls were split right down the middle, hinting at a rather inordinate indifference from this typically speculative crowd.

Looking out to May options, we find more of the same, with the back-month s put/call open interest ratio arriving at 1.03. In fact, AAPL may not see an uptick in options sentiment until the shares seriously put in a challenge to overhead resistance at $145.

Summary

APPLE INC is currently 22.7% above its 200-period moving average and is in an upward trend. Volatility is relatively normal as compared to the average volatility over the last 10 periods. Our volume indicators reflect volume flowing into and out of AAPL.O at a relatively equal pace (neutral). Our trend forecasting oscillators are currently bullish on AAPL.O and have had this outlook for the last 6 periods. our momentum oscillator has set a new 14-period low while the security price has not. This is a bearish divergence. Piper Jaffray Reiterates Overweight Rating and $155 PT on Apple Inc. (AAPL ...  Apple Inc. (AAPL) Showcases What It Has To Offer Via The Technical Chart Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been having a set of eventful trading activity and it is clear from an examination of the charts that traders are now fully aware of the company s key metrics. A deeper exploration of the setup is sure to yield a clearer picture of why AAPL is trending in the way it is presently   let s move right into that. As we move into the full deep dive of the technical chart, it s quite important to point out that few traders succeed if they ignore the messages presented under technical analysis.

AAPL s present state of movement can best be assessed by looking at its current day s high $144.18 and the corresponding low of $143.27. It is important to note that the current day s high figures poorly when compared to the trailing 52-week high of $145.46 achieved by AAPL on 04/05/17. The corresponding low also paints a picture and suggests that the low is nothing but a +60.21% since 05/12/16. From a trading perspective, this is a good sign for anyone keen on making big gains from the stock s prevailing upside potential. Of course the current trading setup is getting a lot of attention from analysts. Most have laid bare their sentiments on the stock as you can see from the following: The target price for AAPL is $147.00; this target is below the most recent high recorded for the stock. There s also the current beta of 1.16. As you might already know, beta is an excellent source of trading sentiment and given that the existing beta for AAPL is greater than 1, traders and investors will no doubt read that AAPL is theoretically more volatile than current market dynamic. These data points are key areas savvy traders will be monitoring.

Many traders are now starting to take a look at the stock and they are eyeing it with a few other technical indicators in mind. Technical indicators don t get more indicative than the measures called Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic. The numbers for AAPL, based on these two very powerful indicators, are indeed very telling. Let s see what they say in greater detail. The current reading for AAPL, where the 14-day RSI is concerned, is 64.32%. This means, based on the reading, that AAPL is neutral, suggesting that the stock is relatively stable in terms of upward or upward price movement. The stochastic reading is also gives consistent interpretations. In relation to AAPL, there is a stochastic reading of 75.19%. This means, based on the stochastic data, that AAPL is overbought at current levels.

AAPL composite picture doesn t end with either the RSI or the Stochastic, however; there are also compelling readings being presented by the stock s 50 and 200 SMAs. AAPL, on account of current trends displayed on its moving averages, appear in all ways and from all angle of analysis, to be bullish. Traders and investors have naturally seized upon this current positioning of the stock and general sentiment appears to be positive.

There are a few technical data points that can add richly to the picture painted above. Once these are baked into the analysis, all becomes clearer. AAPL s +4.20 has now manifested a clearer vein of trading and investing sentiment. When analyzed closely, this sentiment appears to be largely positive assessed over the trailing 30 days of data. AAPL isn t standing still by any means and the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by 19.25. The consequences of this performance have been stark; the stock is now trading on higher volatility levels when compared to matched against companies operating in the same sector. Historical volatility is also showing why AAPL is on the radar of a lot of traders. This reading for historical volatility is 11.24%. AAPL is also pointing to strong readings on the Average True Range   a very important technical touch point that shouldn t be ignored. That ATR reading is 1.04. AAPL has made it clear that from every angle, from every technical touch point, it is ready to make its setup clear to savvy traders and investors keen on making the best of the current state of affairs. One Put, One Call Option To Know About for Apple Consistently, one of the more popular stocks people enter into their stock options watchlist at Stock Options Channel is Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL). So this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one interesting call contract, from the February 2018 expiration for AAPL. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as particularly interesting, is at the $120 strike, which has a bid at the time of this writing of $3.75. Collecting that bid as the premium represents a 3.1% return against the $120 commitment, or a 3.7% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call this the YieldBoost ).

Selling a put does not give an investor access to AAPL's upside potential the way owning shares would, because the put seller only ends up owning shares in the scenario where the contract is exercised. So unless Apple Inc sees its shares fall 16.3% and the contract is exercised (resulting in a cost basis of $116.25 per share before broker commissions, subtracting the $3.75 from $120), the only upside to the put seller is from collecting that premium for the 3.7% annualized rate of return.

Interestingly, that annualized 3.7% figure actually exceeds the 1.6% annualized dividend paid by Apple Inc by 2.1%, based on the current share price of $143.35. And yet, if an investor was to buy the stock at the going market price in order to collect the dividend, there is greater downside because the stock would have to lose 16.29% to reach the $120 strike price.

Always important when discussing dividends is the fact that, in general, dividend amounts are not always predictable and tend to follow the ups and downs of profitability at each company. In the case of Apple Inc, looking at the dividend history chart for AAPL below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue, and in turn whether it is a reasonable expectation to expect a 1.6% annualized dividend yield.

Turning to the other side of the option chain, we highlight one call contract of particular interest for the February 2018 expiration, for shareholders of Apple Inc (Symbol: AAPL) looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.6% annualized dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $165 strike and collecting the premium based on the $4.00 bid, annualizes to an additional 3.3% rate of return against the current stock price (this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the YieldBoost ), for a total of 4.9% annualized rate in the scenario where the stock is not called away. Any upside above $165 would be lost if the stock rises there and is called away, but AAPL shares would have to climb 15.1% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned a 17.9% return from this trading level, in addition to any dividends collected before the stock was called.

The chart below shows the trailing twelve month trading history for Apple Inc, highlighting in green where the $120 strike is located relative to that history, and highlighting the $165 strike in red:

The chart above, and the stock's historical volatility, can be a helpful guide in combination with fundamental analysis to judge whether selling the February 2018 put or call options highlighted in this article deliver a rate of return that represents good reward for the risks. We calculate the trailing twelve month volatility for Apple Inc (considering the last 252 trading day AAPL historical stock prices using closing values, as well as today's price of $143.35) to be 19%.

In mid-afternoon trading on Monday, the put volume among S&P 500 components was 600,880 contracts, with call volume at 600,880, for a put:call ratio of 0.70 so far for the day, which is above normal compared to the long-term median put:call ratio of .65. In other words, if we look at the number of call buyers and then use the long-term median to project the number of put buyers we'd expect to see, we're actually seeing more put buyers than expected out there in options trading so far today.

Top YieldBoost AAPL Calls   Apple Inc. (AAPL) to Stop Supporting 32-Bit Apps with iOS 11 Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has slowly been chipping away at 32-bit apps on the Apple Store for few months. However, the company may serve the final blow this fall. As noted by famed developer Steven Troughton-Smith, it will drop support for 32-bit apps entirely with the iOS 11 release this fall. This juncture means that a big bunch of legacy apps will stop working unless they are updated.

Steven didn t reveal the source of information, but he mentioned that he heard it 'very clearly.' The insight is not much contested because it comes as no surprise to users or developers that AAPL would make this move.

With iOS 9, Apple started notifying users that performance would be inhibited each time a 32-bit app was launched. The prompt also detailed that the app needs an update by the developer. With iOS 10.3, the iPhone maker has upped the ante, replacing the previous prompt with the following:

"This app will not work with future versions of iOS. The developer of this app needs to update it to improve its compatibility."

Smith has also noted that it's likely that future Apple processor will lack 32-bit support entirely, allowing an enhanced performance. Apple doesn't want to alienate users with this move but spur developers to update their applications to the latest platform.

All these efforts are part of Apple's plans to remove "problematic and abandoned apps" from the store. It announced these goals last September, and since then, it has removed over 50,000 apps from the App Store. How Walt Mossberg Changed The Way We Think About Apple, Google And Others Walt Mossberg, a name synonymous with tech reporting, has decided to hang up his boots after a career spanning over 47 years. He made a name as a make-or-break reviewer of technology products, to whom many people looked before finalizing tech purchase decisions.

Booting Into A Journalistic Career

After graduating from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, Mossberg joined the Wall Street Journal in 1970 as a reporter and worked there through 2013. He started his career with the Journal at its Detroit bureau and subsequently moved to the Journal's D.C. office, covering subjects ranging from international to national politics.

Upgrading To Tech Reporting

Mossberg was then vested with the responsibility of handling his own Personal Technology column full time in 1991. This column appeared every Thursday in the Journal from 1991 through 2013.

He also wrote the Mossberg's Mailbox column on Thursdays and edited a column titled "Digital Solution," which appeared on Wednesdays and was written by Katherine Boehret.

Mossberg along with his former WSJ colleague Kara Swisher conceptualized, produced and hosted the Journal's annual D: All Things Digital conference in Carlsbad, California.

The attendees include creative, forward-thinking, insightful leaders in the digital world, ranging from CEOs to industry legends to young innovators. Unlike the usual conferences, which would be predominated by presentations and speeches, D would have Mossberg and Swisher interviewing speakers live onstage.

The All Things Digital web publication was started as an extension of the conference in 2007 by Mossberg and Swisher and carried the former's columns and the latter's blog among other things. It was owned by the Dow Jones & Company, which is now part of News Corp (NASDAQ: NWSA).

Duo Goes Solo...

However, when the duo failed to renew their contract with the Dow Jones in September 2013, they moved out and started Recode, based in San Francisco in January 2014. Recode was subsequently acquired by Vox Media in May 2015. Mossberg also began to contribute to weekly columns in the Verge, also owned by Vox Media.

Currently, he is an executive editor and columnist at the Verge, an editor at large and columnist at Recode and co-host with Nilay Patel of Ctrl-Walt-Delete, a podcast launched in September 2015.

Mossberg And Reviewing Prowess

Mossberg extensively covered product releases of celebrated companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). He had spent a great deal of time with Apple cofounder Steve Jobs, an Apple Insider press release said.

"Walt's relevance and power wasn't just that he was the most influential product reviewer in the world of personal technology a legend it was that he was the best one. Really, he was the only one that mattered. He wasn't just judging your work, positive or negative, he was telling the truth about it. Whether you liked it or not, his opinion was fact," Vox Media CEO Jim Bankoff said in a thank you note to Mossberg.

In an article in the New Yorker titled "Everyone listens to Mossberg," Ken Auletta said how Mossberg recommended America Online, AOL, which is now part of Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), in 1992 for its simplicity and superiority over competition. This helped the service gain traction. The New Yorker article quoted a few instances of his reviews moving the products/services:

Handheld device Palm saw its sales surge in 1996 when Mossberg referred to it as a "breakthrough product."

Blip.tv's viewership got a 25 percent boost in the first 24 hours after he commended the site for its web-based TV shows.

Google's then CEO Eric Schmidt referred to Mossberg as a man who has a good nose after visiting him for getting his insights.

Other Media Appearances

Among his other media appearances are:

CNBC (weekly).

Web video reports.

PC World's Digital Duo, a computer program aired on PBS Stations.

The Swansong

Mossberg is set to step out of the spotlight and into his sunset years in June after the 2017 Code Conference, which he had co-founded in 2003.

"I didn't make this decision lightly, or hastily, or under pressure. It emerged from months of thought and months of talks with my wise wife, my family and close friends. It wasn't prompted by my employer, or by some dire health diagnosis. It just seems like the right time to step away. I'm ready for something new," Mossberg said.

The Life of Apple Founder Steve Jobs Is Becoming an Opera The Life of Apple Founder Steve Jobs Is Becoming an Opera

Operatic portrayals of recent historic figures from Richard Nixon to Walt Disney may be losing their novelty, but that doesn't mean that a stage portrayal of Steve Jobs doesn't inspire huge curiosity. So the Guggenheim Museum's latest Works and Process event on Sunday (repeated at 7:30 pm on Monday) was packed for a sneak preview of the latest Santa Fe Opera premiere, The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs, with the creative team on hand to introduce the various excerpts.

The first full-length opera by the fashionable 40-year-old composer Mason Bates has a solid foundation with the seasoned librettist Mark Campbell and director Kevin Newbury, plus a promising game plan: The storytelling won't be traditional or linear. Bates and Campbell summed up the opera's emotional nexus like this: Just because Jobs made the world more seamless, stylish and tidy, the humanity around him didn't become any less messy.  It's life simplified versus life out of control,  said Bates.

Composer Mason Bates, here with Daniel Bernard Roumain, will debut his opera about Steve Jobs in July. (Todd Rosenberg)

Bates sees no lack of the gravity that's needed for an operatic subject: "I absolutely take him seriously. Changing the way we communicate was quite an achievement, though some might say for better and for worse." And no, the operatic Jobs won't worry about high notes since the role is written in the baritone range, somewhat inspired by Britten's Billy Budd.



But in all seriousness, Campbell suggested that the hallmark of The (R)evolution of Steve Jobs may be the playfulness of the music:  That's what we need in opera now.  Campbell's libretto also captures the subversive West Coast counterculture from which Jobs and his partner Steve Wozniak emerged, with scenes of them smoking pot together, making a crank phone call to the Vatican and impersonating Henry Kissinger. In one of the more visionary scenes, Jobs takes LSD (the purple microdot variety) and hears music.



The callous side of Jobs was Campbell's big barrier with the subject: He needed to find a character worth caring about, and apparently succeeded: Though Jobs is by no means whitewashed, Campbell now refers to the computer magnate he never met with first-name familiarity. On Bates' side, the challenge was to apply his typical fusion of traditional symphonic orchestra and high-tech electronics.  Because Jobs has this busy inner soul, he was always kind of restless and nervous. I felt that electronics could very well portray that,  said Bates. "It's a little like having a wind machine or thunder sheet in an orchestra. It increases the three-dimensionality of it. 



The San Francisco-based composer also includes sounds sampled from a 1985 computer as well as electronic effects that seem all but quoted from pop music of Jobs' early adulthood, specifically the classic album  Who's Next.   I don't know that one,  Bates said,  but those kinds of sounds come down through the ether. 



The musical excerpts   sung by Sarah Coit, Edward Parks, Wei Wu, Garrett Sorenson and Jessica Jones   touched on a wide range of styles, with harmonically saturated moments when Jobs has an ecstatic realization and vocal writing that sometimes bordered on jazz bebop. Though Jobs' real-life widow Laurene campaigned against the making of the 2015 film Steve Jobs, the opera team hasn't heard from her. Just for the record, she comes off sympathetically as a voice of reason in his world, though one who couldn't get him to properly treat the cancer that killed him in 2011.



The creative team's greatest hope for the July 22 Aug. 15 run in Santa Fe also contains the ultimate irony: They're hoping that at the end of the opera, listeners will be too entranced to whip out their phones. Jay-Z Pulls Out His Solo Albums From Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music And Spotify Jay-Z s solo albums will no lo longer be available on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music and Spotify streaming services. The removal of the services came as a request of the artist. Though unconfirmed, the removal has also been associated with Jay Z s ownership of Tidal, the high-resolution audio streaming service that is yet to get a stronghold on the market.

However, all is not lost even with the absence of Jay Z s 12 studio albums as this only affects those within the US. Those outside the US territory can still find the star s creative works courtesy of the intricacies international licensing laws. Google Play Music and Deezer, which are smaller music services, are also custodians of the rapper s catalog.

Jay-Z s Fans Switch To Tidal?

The streaming music services industry is overwhelmed with competition. There are speculations that Jay-Z a.k.a. Shawn Carter could be trying to woo his fans into Tidal, which is now in competition with Apple, Spotify, and Amazon. However, Tidal has not commented on the speculations, hence, strategies of building an appeal for its subscriber s remains unclear.

Apparently, the acquiring of the streaming service in 2014 was meant to give Jay-Z s peers a bigger share of the profits. The rapper has previously criticized online music services for poor compensation of artists. This comes at a time when the music industry sales are said to be growing thanks to the increasing number of paying subscribers.

Tidal A Solid Investment

Apparently, some of Jay-Z s albums that have been removed from the two services are over a decade old. In reference to the time Tidal was acquired, the question, which begs an answer is, why has it taken so long for the rapper to take the drastic move?

That aside, the streaming service may still be far from having firm market grip but its focus on exclusives is notable. Its investment is also worth noting given that there are those who have already shown the interest in having a stake in it.

In the meantime, Apple s stock closed at $143.34 a fall of $0.32 or 0.22%.

What's Fueling Investor Confidence? - Apple Inc. (AAPL), Wells Fargo & Company ... Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are making a strong comeback as they have jumped 62.61% since bottoming out at $89.47 on May. 12, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.22% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 24.3% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -1.46% from $144.5 , the 52-week high touched on Apr. 05, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 34.7% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy Apple Inc. (AAPL) s shares projecting a $147 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

AAPL s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 14.8% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 3.3% looks unattractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Apple Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 20.73%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 4.59%, and the sector s average is 4.62%. In that light, it seems in weak position compared to its peers and sector.

Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -8.58% since hitting a peak level of $59.99 on Mar. 01, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -6.58% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 0.19% so far on the year   still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 27.84% higher from $43.55, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Oct. 04, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 23.22% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $54.84, WFC has a chance to add $4.23 or 7.71% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($59.07) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.7 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.93 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Wells Fargo & Company s EPS growth has been nearly 7.2%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 7.46%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Wells Fargo & Company s ROE is 11.78%, while industry s is 16.05%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 15.39%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. WFC s ROA is 1.19%, while industry s average is 2.31%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 2.43.

1 Awesome Feature Coming to This Year's Apple Inc. iPhone Models In early 2016, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launched the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. One of the most interesting features of the device was the inclusion of a True Tone display. Per Apple, this technology uses "advanced four-channel ambient light sensors to automatically adapt the color and intensity of the display to match the light in your environment."

Unfortunately, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus smartphones launched in the fall of 2017 didn't include this technology. However, per a new research report from Barclays (via MacRumors), it looks as though this year's iPhone models -- all three of them -- will get the True Tone display.

A nice improvement

Apple's OLED iPhone -- which is widely referred to as the iPhone 8 -- is likely to pack many significant new features compared to the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models. The addition of True Tone display to the iPhone 8 is likely to be just one of many compelling new features that could potentially drive significant upgrade activity among current iPhone users, as well as possible defections from premium Android smartphone users.

The more standard iPhone 7s and iPhone 7s Plus, on the other hand, are rumored to have much less interesting updates.

For example, rumors seem to point to similar -- if not identical -- industrial designs for the iPhone 7s/7s Plus relative to the iPhone 7/7 Plus phones. In a world increasingly populated with stylish smartphones that likely more closely resemble Apple's upcoming iPhone 8 rather than Apple's relatively dated-looking iPhone 7/7 Plus, Apple will need some incredibly compelling and useful features to make the iPhone 7s/7s Plus attractive to customers if the rumors about the 7s/7s Plus designs are true.

Features like True Tone, which really do enhance the user experience, can certainly help in that respect.

What else can Apple bring to the "standard" iPhone models?

A True Tone display likely won't be enough to really get customers excited about the "standard" iPhone 7s/iPhone 7s Plus models. Given that Apple is in the business of trying to develop products that excite customers, it's worth speculating a bit about what other features Apple could bring to these devices.

To start, there's plenty of room for Apple to improve its camera subsystems. Apple used to be known for offering unmatched camera experiences on its iPhones, but lately the competition has been able to field extremely competitive cameras -- in some cases, arguably better than what Apple currently sells.

For example, the iPhone 7 scores 86 in camera performance tests performed by DXOMark. This makes the camera one of the best smartphone cameras out there, but among its peers in the premium smartphone space, it's hardly the leader. The Huawei P10 and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus score an 87; the Galaxy S7 Edge and HTC 10 achieve scores of 88; and the Pixel tops the charts with a score of 89.

If Apple wants a nice selling point for even its potentially stale-looking iPhone 7s/7s Plus, it could start by equipping them with cameras that can top the competition in DXOMark's tests (though it would be OK if they lost to the camera subsystem found inside of the OLED-packing iPhone 8).

Along with a large leap in camera performance and the addition of a True Tone display, Apple is rumored to be adding some type of fast-charging technology to its 2017 iPhone lineup. This is one of those features that has long been present in competing smartphones that has the potential to make life much more convenient for iPhone users.

In addition to the above improvements, Apple is also likely to bring a boost in processor, graphics, and wireless performance this year -- as is standard for new iPhone launches. Apple: Key Analyst Research Themes  1 More Negative for This Small Apple Inc. Supplier By this point, the tech investment community is probably aware of graphics specialist Imagination Technologies' (NASDAQOTH: IGNMF) announcement that Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has decided to abandon the former's graphics technology for entirely internally developed technology.

Continue Reading Below

This is very clearly devastating news for Imagination, which relied on Apple for more than half of its revenue during its fiscal year 2016. If that Apple-related revenue completely dries up, it's hard to see how Imagination can survive as a stand-alone entity with its current corporate cost structure.

Image source: Imagination Tech.

Even if Imagination eventually finds a way to get around the potential financial devastation that losing the Apple revenue stream would cause the company, there's a big risk Imagination now faces as its future hangs in the balance.

Would you stay at Imagination?

For a moment, try to put yourself in the shoes of a current Imagination engineer. Prior to this announcement, you were probably aware that Imagination was facing some financial difficulties, but at the same time, you knew that -- if you could do your job well -- you'd probably be able to count on having a well-paying job for the foreseeable future since Apple depends heavily on the technologies you are working on.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

Following Apple's recent notice to Imagination and the subsequent public dissemination of that notice, Imagination's future is now incredibly uncertain because of Imagination's heavy reliance on Apple.

So, if you are such an engineer, and you've got a mortgage to pay and a family to feed, what's the next logical step considering this uncertainty? You're going to start sending out your resumes to companies with more certain futures.

For example, Apple has been making a lot of noise about building up a graphics team in the U.K -- no doubt in support of Apple's ambitions to cease using Imagination's technology in favor of internally developed technologies. I'm sure Apple would be happy to bring aboard more of Imagination's engineering staff to help it design its next-generation graphics processors.

It's not just Apple that would likely be willing to employ Imagination's engineering staff. Companies like ARM Holdings (Imagination's major competitor in mobile graphics technology licensing) andQualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM) (the market share leader in mobile applications processors) are surely on the hunt for great mobile graphics talent, too.

I could also see Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) potentially wanting to grab some of this talent, as it seems to be working to improve its internal graphics efforts (which are certainly in need of work to make them more efficient) in service of its personal computer and Internet of Things products.

The point is, there are a lot of companies out there that would be interested in hiring engineers known for building some of the world's best low-power mobile graphics technologies, and I wouldn't be surprised to see some, if not all, of these companies step up their efforts in trying to recruit Imagination's (likely much more receptive) engineering talent in the near to medium term.

Brain drain is a huge risk

Even if Imagination somehow manages to ink a deal with Apple that allows it to live to fight another day, the potential brain drain Imagination could suffer in the meantime could weaken the company's long-term ability to develop and market competitive technologies.

Things don't look good for the company right now.

Try This Apple Inc. Trade Before the Correction Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been sweet to investors over the past couple weeks. But don t let your imagination get the best of you   even the biggest and best companies correct. And while nobody expects Apple to sour overnight, being positioned for that strategy makes plenty of cents   er, sense, too.

Let me explain.

British Apple supplier Imagination Technologies is finding out the hard way what it means to lose a contract with the world s largest publicly traded company   and when business is heavily concentrated in having that relationship work.

In Monday s session, foreign-listed shares of the chip designer plunged by roughly 70% after Apple announced is making an internal move to manufacture its own graphics processor units (GPUs) within the next two years.

Investors aren t exactly applauding the news over at Apple. But with shares situated just off all-time highs following a fairly hefty and extended price run, maybe the reaction is more akin to a  bugger off!  ennui.

The Weekly Chart of Apple Stock



Click to Enlarge Technically, Apple has made quite a run over the past few months. From Apple s corrective low of $90 set last May, shares are up a whopping 60%. In the process, Apple has also reclaimed the undisputed title of world s largest publicly traded company by a massively wide margin.

During the past few months, shares have also become increasingly sweet   perhaps too much so. It s my view that given this evolving price action, Newton s law of gravity looks ripe.

One need only look at the provided weekly chart to appreciate how very different the rally off the corrective lows has been over the course of the move higher.

From a fairly cautious-looking beginning with waves of buying followed by more modest periods of selling over several months, 2017 has been marked by a much more confident program of hugging the upper Bollinger Band with nary a pullback. That s looking technically troublesome for Apple in the short-term.

It s important to know that the trend is your friend, right up until it s not. Generally, this transition doesn t happen out of the blue, and instead occurs when it looks like there s nothing but blue skies ahead.

Apple is exhibiting this behavior right now.

Don t get me wrong: I m not bearish on Apple; I m simply cognizant of the chart, which clearly has captivated bulls  imaginations. But it more likely has 3% to 7% downside before making a similar run back to the upside.

How to Trade Apple Right Now

At the moment, I like the 5 May $140/$136/$130 put butterfly.

This trade is priced for a small debit of 30 cents with Apple shares at $143.75. This position carries minimal risk if the stock fails to drop below $140 (roughly 3%) over the next month.

The risk control is a nice feature of this variation on the butterfly spread, especially with earnings slated later this month. Below $140, the position can profit similar to short stock on a move down to $136. At expiration, the potential maximum gain is $3.70 per spread, representing a corrective move of nearly 6%.

The real risk for traders anticipating a pullback while using this strategy is recognizing the impact of the lower and wider $136/$130 embedded bull put spread. The trader s breakeven at expiration is $132.30. This allows for a maximum loss of $2.05 if Apple falls below $130 at expiration.

Bottom line: If you believe that corrective moves are meant to be bought, then this trade could turn a potentially sour move into a very sweet opportunity.

However, the absolute numbers are probably less impressive.

The demographic structure of the Indian market is more preferable for Apple than that of the Chinese market.

In the context of the basic parameters of the smartphone market, India is where China was six years ago.

Looking ahead, we're seeing some very exciting developments in India. (Timothy Donald Cook)

Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) entry into the Chinese market, followed by the record sales growth, was the key driver of doubling of the company's shares in the period from 2013 to 2015. However, when this market demonstrated signs of saturation, its price decreased.

Now, in order to continue the stable growth of capitalization, Apple needs a new market that would have potential comparable with that of the Chinese market. Today, the only similar market in the whole world is India. Apple has long been well aware of this and, therefore, has been taking steps to enter and secure a foothold in this market. This is evidenced by the fact that Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, recently visited India in order to discuss the opening of retail stores with the Prime Minister of the country.

Before sharing my thoughts on the potential for Apple's products in India, I would like to point out that by saying "Apple's products" I basically mean the iPhone. According to last quarter, the sales of smartphones accounted for 69% of the total Apple's revenue, and the dynamics suggest that the situation will not change in the near future.

Let's take a look at India in the context of the key parameters of the smartphone market.

According to the study conducted by Google and The Boston Consulting Group, from 2015 to 2020, the number of smartphone users in India will double, amounting to 520 million, or 39% of the country's projected population:

These indicators are exactly comparable with those of China back in the year 2014:

In other words, in the context of the quantitative amount of the smartphone market, India is where China was six years ago. The sales of Apple's products in China peaked in 2015. It means a similar boom in India can be expected only in 2021.

Let's compare the demographics of India and China.

According to current projections, in fifteen years, the population of India will overtake that of China, and it needs no comment:

Source: statisticstimes.com

In demographic terms, India is a young country. More than 50% of its population is under the age of 25:

Source: CIA

It is noteworthy that this age structure will not undergo substantial changes in the next twenty years.

The situation in China is different. More than 50% of China's population is in the age range of 25-45:

And in the next twenty years, this range will rise to 40-65 years.

The prospects of the demographic situation are directly related to Apple, as the main buyers of smartphones are mostly young people. For example, in China, the highest smartphone penetration is among the individuals in the age range of 18-24. I am sure the situation in India is similar.

We can make an interim conclusion: in terms of the age structure of the population, in the long term, India is even more preferable for Apple than China because there will probably be a larger number of potential smartphone buyers. But only in the long term.

The economic liberalization that started in India in 1991 involves the growth of the middle class - the main potential consumer of Apple products.

Back in 1991, the income structures of the population of India and China were similar - the average annual income of more than 90% of the population was less than $5,000. However, in 2015, the so-called middle class (with annual revenues between $10,000 to $45,000) in China amounted to 33.6%, compared to only 23.4% in India.

Source: livemint.com

China expands its economy toward the domestic consumption, which guarantees that its middle class will grow for many years to come. At the same time, India continues on the path of industrialization, and the country's domestic demand remains weak, at least judging by the sales of durable goods, as well as the growth rate of customer credit.

In my opinion, in the context of the formation of consumer demand necessary for Apple, India still has a long way to go, which is clearly not limited to the next few years.

Apple does not disclose the exact sales figures in India. All that we can analyze is the dynamics of the segment "Rest of Asia-Pacific", which includes India.

According to the results of 2016, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, stated the following:

Our iPhone sales in India were up over 50% in fiscal 2016 compared to the prior year...

Perhaps, the growth is impressive percentage-wise, but if you look at the dynamics of absolute changes in Apple's sales by region, it becomes apparent that the region "Rest of Asia-Pacific" still cannot be compared to the dynamics that China showed two years ago.

PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

In the long term, India may become an even bigger market for Apple than China. However, in the near future, the consumer demand and the current phase of development of the smartphone market in India indicate the low probability of Apple's double-digit revenue growth in this market.

Ashraf Eassa has no position in any stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool owns shares of and recommends Apple. The Motley Fool has the following options: long January 2018 $90 calls on Apple and short January 2018 $95 calls on Apple. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy. Monday's Vital Data: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and Comcast ... U.S. stock futures are headed for a mixed open this morning, as pressure from falling oil prices applies pressure in the first trading day of the second quarter. Crude fell in Asian trading due to global oversupply worries in the wake of higher U.S. rig counts and rising U.S. shale production. A stronger U.S. dollar also put pressure on oil prices, and is helping to pressure futures early this morning.

Against this backdrop, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.07%, S&P 500 futures are almost flat and Nasdaq-100 futures have gained 0.1%.

On the options front, volume came in relatively average considering both the quarter and the month came to an end on Friday. Overall, only about 13.6 million calls and 12.4 million puts changed hands on Friday. On the CBOE, the single-session equity put/call volume ratio ticked lower to 0.56, while the 10-day moving average held at 0.64 for a third consecutive session.

Driving Friday s options volume, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) remained on top among options traders after outperforming all other Dow stocks for the quarter. Elsewhere, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) capped a strong week of gains by throwing its hat in the ring of bidders for Toshiba s NAND flash memory unit. Finally, Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ: CMCSA ) trades ex-dividend today, driving heavy call volume.

Apple Inc. (AAPL)

Judging by the first quarter, 2017 could be a banner year for AAPL stock. The shares outperformed all others on the Dow Jones, gaining more than 23% so far on the year.

The quarter was marked by a strong corporate earnings and plenty of speculation surrounding the next iteration of the iPhone. While AAPL stock has consolidated in recent sessions, the shares remain just shy of all-time high territory and should be bolstered by growing round-number support in the $140 region.

Options traders appear to be rallying behind the recent strength, as Friday s volume topped 895,000 contracts, with calls snapping up 63% of the day s take. What s more, the April put/call open interest ratio may have put in a top on Wednesday last week, as the reading has moderated from a peak of 0.96 to hover at 0.95 for the past two sessions. A reversal higher could be a sign of short-term concern, but if today s activity drives the reading lower, we could see AAPL trend higher heading into April expiration.

Next Page Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Might Launch Premium TV Bundle Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is said to be working to launch a premium TV bundle, according to a report from Recode.

According to the report, the Cupertino-based tech giant is planning to sell consumers a premium TV bundle, which combines HBO, Showtime, and Starz.

 Apple already sells each of those channels individually. But it has approached the three networks about rolling them up into a single package, as conventional pay TV operators sometimes do,  Recode reported.

Unlike traditional pay TV operators that consumers to subscribe to a basic level of TV channels to get a premium bundle, Apple plans to sell the bundle as standalone product, delivered via its iOS devices and Apple TV set-top box, the report said.

Citing industry sources, the publication reported that the iPhone maker does not  have a bundle deal in place with any of the premium networks. 

Currently, Apple offers HBO for $15 a month, Showtime for $11 a month, and Starz for $9 a month. It is clear yet what price the company is seeking for its proposed premium bundle.

Eddy Cue, senior vice president of Internet Software and Services at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), has said that traditional TV networks are not  willing to make the concessions he wants to sell a TV package.  However,  a premium bundle would be much easier, since he already sells those networks individually. The main question would be the price and the percentage of revenue the network owners would want,  Recode reported.

Meanwhile, Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed 0.19% down on Friday. The stock is up more than 24% year-to-date, versus a 5.53% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. During the last 12 months, AAPL has gained 30.61%.

In other Apple news, the tech giant is said to launch a completely new iPhone model in September this year. Dubbed the iPhone 8, the premium handset is rumored to come with revolutionary features.

Apple Fellow Rich Page on 'stealing jobs' and Chowbotics' salad-making robots When we first wrote about Chowbotics, their salad-making robot, which was then just a prototype, stirred a bit of controversy. The company promises to bring nutritious dining options to offices that don t have a big cafeteria and budget to employ full-time chefs. But, like other food automation technologies, their robot, Sally, threatens to put a number of people out of work if it replaces prep cooks in restaurants.

This week, we interviewed Chowbotics Executive Chairman Rich Page, who worked alongside Steve Jobs pioneering personal computer design at Apple Inc. and as a co-founder of NeXT Computer. He and Chowbotics CEO Deepak Sekar gave TechCrunch a first look at the finished robot. Sally will soon be installed and start dishing out the greens in venues from co-working spaces to hospitals.

What makes Sally different than a vending machine, Page explained, is the use of sensors and various moving parts inside.  A vending machine will just drop things out,  he said.  There s significant motion in here. The primary weight sensor controls the amount Sally dispenses of each ingredient. Users  choices determine which ingredients are used at all. 

Chopped, whole and liquid ingredients are stored in individual tubes, and the system knows which is in each, whether it s a dressing, vegetable, cheese or other toppings. The tubes are filled at least once a day by people. The system sends alerts to customers when any ingredient is running low and needs a refill.

Making sure the robot s design was compact enough, and durable enough to be used repeatedly in office and retail environments was a major challenge the company had to overcome. According to Sekar, the startup has been fielding inquiries from hospitals, which like the idea of salads prepared hygienically by robots, rather than under a  sneeze guard  at a traditional salad bar.

Does the startup worry about  stealing jobs ? Page says the company, and others involved in food automation and robotics, shouldn t hold back on innovation:  There s always some trade-off between existing jobs and new jobs. This causes some frustration in the world. But in general the world goes farther, and things get better for everybody. 

He reflected on the early days of his career when typing pools were replaced by word processors, and spreadsheets migrated from paper to a program called Visicalc that ran on the Apple II. Page said,  You can argue that put some people out of work, but it created an increase in productivity, too.

How Apple Inc. Makes Most of Its Money It shouldn't surprise anyone that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) makes most of its money from the iPhone. After its initial launch in mid-2007, the iPhone gradually replaced the iPod as Apple's biggest revenue driver. Between fiscal 2008 and 2016, Apple's iPhone shipments surged from 11.6 million to 211.9 million. During that period, Apple's annual revenue rose from $32.5 billion to $215.6 billion.

The seminal iPhone helped Apple crush former mobile kings Nokia and BlackBerry, sparked a tech shift which turned Microsoft and Intel into underdogs, and made it the most valuable company in the world with a market cap of about $750 billion. Let's take a closer look at how important the iPhone is to Apple, and why its success is also a double-edged sword.

How much does the iPhone matter to Apple?

The annual launch of new iPhones remains one of the biggest tech events of the year for consumers, tech journalists, Wall Street analysts, and investors. But demand for the phones has clearly been slowing, due to competition from high-end Android rivals and the saturation of major markets like the U.S. and China. That's why last year's 211.9 million shipments actually represent an 8% decline from the 231.2 million units the company shipped in 2015.

However, analysts believe that the tenth-anniversary iPhone 8 -- which will likely feature a glass body, edge-to-edge bezel-less OLED screen, and numerous hardware improvements -- will get growth back on track. Goldman Sachs analyst Simona Jankowski believes that iPhone shipments in calendar 2017 will reach 230 million. Last quarter, Apple's iPhone sales grew 5% annually and accounted for a whopping 69% of the company's top line.

Apple produces iPhones for about $200 and sells them for over $600. That total excludes R&D, marketing, and other expenses, but it still allows Apple to make a lot more money than Android OEMs, which are selling their devices at much thinner margins. That's why research firm Strategy Analytics reported that at the end of 2016, Apple raked in 79% of the entire smartphone industry's profits, despite controlling just 18% of the global market. That's also why Apple constantly promotes its devices as luxury products.

It's also how Apple takes prisoners

But it's not just the hardware revenue that matters to Apple -- the iPhone also represents the easiest way to lock users into iOS. After iPhone users start buying apps and media from the App Store and iTunes, they're less likely to leave behind their purchases by switching to Android devices.

Apple clearly knows that its lock-in strategy works. That's why it boldly launched an "upgrade" program which lets people pay for their iPhones on a monthly basis for two years. That plan also gives customers AppleCare+ coverage, and works with all carriers since users are buying an unsubsidized device. After 12 months, users can switch to the latest iPhone to reset the payment process.

It's highly unlikely that an Android OEM can launch a comparable "forever" plan, since Android users can easily swap between handset brands without losing all their Google Play content.

It's a launchpad for Apple Services

That brand loyalty makes the iPhone an ideal launch pad for Apple's growing Services business, which includes the App Store, iTunes, iBooks, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and Apple Music. CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly stated that Apple plans to grow its software services to offset its gradual slowdown in iPhone sales. Apple's Services revenue rose 18% annually and accounted for 9% of its top line last quarter, but there have been a few speed bumps.

Apple claims that Apple Pay's user base tripled over the past year, but Loup Venture recently claimed that just 13% of iPhone users have ever used the service. Wal-Mart still doesn't accept Apple Pay, and the service is still being trampled by Tencent's WePay and Alibaba's AliPay in China. Apple Music hit 20 million paid subscribers at the end of 2016, but questions about the platform's profit margins persist.

Why is the iPhone a double-edged sword?

It's easy to see why the iPhone is a double-edged sword. As long as iPhone sales are rising year-over-year, investors will be happy. But once interest in the iPhone finally fades, Apple needs new products and services to pick up the slack.

Mac sales rose and iPad annual sales fell last quarter, but their combined sales only accounted for 16% of Apple's revenues. The Apple Watch still generates so little revenue that it's included in the Other Products category, along with iPods, Apple TV, and Beats audio devices.

No one is sure what Apple's next big move will be -- whether it be new hardware products, media acquisitions, or connected cars -- but most investors agree that it needs to reduce the weight of the mighty iPhone on its top line.

People Are More Satisfied With Microsoft Surface Than Apple iPad (MSFT, AAPL) Microsoft Corporation s (NASDAQ: MSFT ) Surface customers are the happiest and most satisfied when it comes to user experience, and this feeling is far deeper than it is for those using Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPads.

According to J.D. Power, the reason people are more satisfied using the Surface than the iPad is that the former boasts not just of better features, but its design and styling factors are also superior.

Apple s Jony Ive will really be disheartened to learn this.

Microsoft Surface vs. Apple iPad

In J.D. Power s U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study, the Surface scored 855 points (out of 1,000), beating Apple by six points. The Surface s connectivity, accessories and pre-loaded apps won the hearts of most users. Other factors such as the beauty of the design and the tablet s size and build also attracted buyers. According to the survey, Microsoft Surface owners were also found to use more accessories, including a stylus (48% vs. 27% industry average), physical keyboard (51% vs. 14%) and mouse (27% vs. 6%)

J.D. Power s vice president of service industries, Jeff Conklin, said,  The Microsoft Surface platform has expanded what tablets can do, and it sets the bar for customer satisfaction. These tablet devices are just as capable as many laptops, yet they can still function as standard tablets. This versatility is central to their appeal and success. 

It was found in the study that 51% of Microsoft customers believe they are usually the first ones in their circle of friends and colleagues to try new technology. This means that the majority of people choose Surface tablets instead of iPads when looking for the newest devices, notes CNBC.

Apple created the modern tablet computer market with the launch of the iPad in 2010. Thereafter, in 2012, Microsoft reinvested the segment by developing convertible tablets. In 2015, Apple then came up with its own convertible, the iPad Pro.

It must be noted that though Apple has seen a sharp decline in quarterly tablet sales, it still leads the market. The risk, however, exists for Apple to lose its bigger market share to Microsoft s tablets.

Other Survey Findings

The study, which was conducted between October and December 2016, was based on a sample of 2,238 U.S. tablet owners who have been using the device for less than a year. Users were asked to rate their tablets on five parameters: style and design, features, cost, performance and ease of operation.

The survey also found that average customer satisfaction with tablets has been rising. At 841, it is higher than the 2016 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Study by 21 index points.

However, brands like LG Display Co Ltd. (ADR) (NYSE: LPL ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Asus and Acer failed to meet this average, with scores of 836, 834, 812 and 814 respectively.

Second, when customers select a tablet, they give the most importance to factors like lower price and past experience, with reputation being the next most important criterion.

Third, the average screen length diagonally is important. The larger the screen length, the greater the satisfaction level.

Last, data plans also have much to do with satisfaction level. Customers with data plans had satisfaction levels as high as 863, while those without a plan scored just 834.

More From InvestorPlace Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) iPhone 8 Tipped to Sport Smart Connector, Again A new report from Israeli site The Verifier has today claimed that iPhone 8 is set to sport the iPad Pro Smart Connector, and it will be used for wireless charging and augmented reality features in the future.

Apple debuted the Smart Connector in 2015 with the introduction of its 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It was initially reported, by several news outlets, that last year s flagship iPhone would sport the Smart Connector that s mainly used to attach a keyboard to iPad Pro. Not a lot of hints were given about its functionality, however, but it was predicted that the Connector would be able to facilitate attachments on iPhone, for the first time.

To recall, it is reported that this year Apple is set to launch not two, but three variants of the flagship iPhone. Two of them would be the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus, while the third will be the 10th anniversary edition, or iPhone 8 as it is referred to in rumors. It is in that third variant that the Smart Connector is rumored to be present, for the same periphery connection purpose that it fulfills in iPad Pro.

The Verifier is a relatively new source for Apple news, but it is certainly making a good go of it to be reckoned as a reliable outlet for all things Apple. Previously, it has claimed that iOS 11, set to be released this summer at the Worldwide Developers Conference, will introduce a number of changes including FaceTime group video calling, and a massive Siri revamp to bring it up to speed.

Why Apple Inc. Wants to Build Its Own Graphics Processors  Apple, Inc. Admits to Mac Pro Design Flaws, Promises New Model Coming It's just embarrassing at this point. For a company that famously demarcated the consumer and professional markets decades ago and worked hard to cater to each of those markets, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has rightfully received an incredible amount of criticism that it is seemingly neglecting the professional market (at least when it comes to desktop users). The Mac Pro, redesigned and launched in 2013, has continued to gather dust over the years with no updates whatsoever -- until now.

The big news today is that Apple invited a handful of journalists to its campus to deliver the message that a newly redesigned Mac Pro is coming. Not this year, but hopefully next. In the meantime, Apple will be bumping the specs of the Mac Pro for the first time in nearly four years.

"We're sorry"

Apple doesn't apologize often. The most recent and prominent apology was the Apple Maps fiasco from five years ago that contributed to Scott Forstall's ouster, in part because he reportedly refused to apologize; CEO Tim Cook had to apologize on Apple's behalf instead.

For the Mac Pro, Apple is implicitly admitting that its design -- the sleek black jet engine -- was flawed. Apple designed the system with dual GPUs, while creative professionals have been shifting toward a single, larger and more powerful GPU. The problem was that the current design had thermal limitations that couldn't accommodate a more powerful GPU. According to John Gruber, Marketing Chief Phil Schiller then uttered the S-word:

The current Mac Pro, as we've said a few times, was constrained thermally and it restricted our ability to upgrade it. And for that, we're sorry to disappoint customers who wanted that, and we've asked the team to go and rearchitect and design something great for the future that those Mac Pro customers who want more expandability, more upgradability in the future. It'll meet more of those needs.

Schiller's famous line from the 2013 unveiling, "Can't innovate anymore, my [butt]," is now coming back to bite him in precisely that spot.

Meanwhile, the iMac is starting to serve a meaningful chunk of Apple's professional customers, considering the "consumer" desktop's current capabilities. The iMac is also due for an upgrade, although it's in less dire need than the Mac Pro; Schiller says an iMac spec bump is slated for "this year." Interestingly, Apple executives said a new professional display is also in the works, despite prior comments that Apple was exiting the stand-alone display market and instead partnering with other companies.

Apple noted that about 20% of Mac sales are still desktops, which is a higher proportion than most would think. The company has sold $23.3 billion worth of Macs over the past year.

Why Apple had to speak out

Apple pre-announcing a product is almost unheard of, as it's often aiming to avoid the infamous Osborne effect that led to Osborne Computer's failure in the 1980s. I can only think of two notable examples: The iPhone was pre-announced six months prior to launch in 2007, and the Apple Watch was pre-announced by a comparable amount of time in fall 2014 ahead of the spring 2015 launch. The common thread there is that those were both entries into then-new product categories, so pre-announcing had greater potential to hurt competitors than Apple itself.

That's why the announcement of an upcoming Mac Pro that won't be launched until next year (or later) is unique. It will be a rather long wait for a new product in a mature category. Apple probably feels like it has no choice, though, as it's been backed into a corner with criticisms from professional customers that feel like they're being abandoned. Remaining silent for another year or more would be untenable, as it would risk that those users would defect to another platform. Apple had to say something, but pros will still have to wait a little longer for a redesign. Apple Inc. Reportedly Orders 70 Million OLED Screens for Premium iPhone  Bullish on Apple Inc? You'll Love These 3 Stocks Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 30% rally over the past 12 months surprised many investors, who likely assumed that waning interest in iPhones would limit its upside potential. Yet robust demand for the iPhone 7 helped Apple beat both top and bottom line expectations for three straight quarters. Its sales are now expected to rise 6% this year, compared to an 8% decline in 2016.

If you think that Apple still has room to run, you should also check out three of its top suppliers -- Cirrus Logic (NASDAQ:CRUS), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), and Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) -- which could all be lifted by the tech giant's rally.

Cirrus Logic

Cirrus Logic makes audio chips for Apple devices. Two-thirds of its revenue came from Apple in fiscal 2016, making it a top supply chain bet on the iPhone 7 and the upcoming iPhone 8. Sales rose 28% to $1.2 billion in 2016, and analysts anticipate another 31% growth this year.

Cirrus' heavy exposure to Apple is certainly risky, but it's gradually diversified away from its top customer -- which generated 80% of its sales back in 2014. One growing customer is Samsung, which accounted for 15% of its 2016 sales. Looking further ahead, digital headsets, MEMS mics, voice biometrics, and growth among China OEMs could all boost its content share and diversify its top line beyond those two top smartphone makers.

Cirrus' non-GAAP earnings dipped 10% in 2016 due to the impact of a patent deal. But looking ahead, its earnings are expected to rise a whopping 82% this year. Cirrus already rallied more than 60% over the past 12 months on Apple's strength, but it still trades at just 17 times earnings -- which is well below its industry average of 75.

Analog Devices

Analog Devices sells the sensor controllers which power Apple's Force Touch feature, which senses how much pressure is applied to a touchscreen or trackpad. The feature is used on new iPhones, MacBooks, and Apple Watches. The company's "largest single customer" (widely assumed to be Apple) accounted for 12% of its sales in 2016.

That lower percentage makes Analog a more diversified play than Cirrus. It also provides other analog chips, amplifiers, digital signal processing products, and software to a wide variety of companies across the industrial, communications, and automotive markets. Nonetheless, analysts expect Apple's growth to help lift its sales by 44% this year, compared to nearly flat growth in 2016. Its non-GAAP earnings are expected to rise 30%.

Analog also pays a forward dividend yield of 2.2%, which is comfortably supported by a payout ratio of 57%. It's hiked that dividend annually ever since its IPO in 2012. The stock's P/E of 28 is admittedly higher than its industry average of 22, but that premium can likely be justified by its above-average growth rates.

Skyworks Solutions

Skyworks Solutions provides radio-frequency (RF) chips for the mobile, automotive, broadband, wireless infrastructure, smart home, industrial, and military markets. However, Apple is widely believed to be its biggest customer, accounting for 40% of its sales in fiscal 2016. Teardowns of the iPhone 7 reveal four Skyworks components inside, compared to two components in the iPhone 6s.

That's why Skyworks' revenue is expected to rise 9% this year, compared to less than 1% growth last year. Non-GAAP earnings are expected to grow 11% this year. Skyworks pays a seemingly low forward dividend of 1.1%, but its low payout ratio of 23% indicate that there's plenty of room for annual hikes -- which it has done for two straight years.

Skyworks is gradually reducing its dependence on Apple by expanding into adjacent markets like connected cars, smart homes, and other Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It's also scoring more design wins with Android OEMs. Skyworks currently trades at 21 times earnings, which is slightly lower than its industry average of 22.

But beware the fate of Imagination Technologies...

If I had to buy just one of these stocks, I'd pick Analog Devices for its diversified business and solid dividend. Cirrus and Skyworks are still great Apple plays, but investors should realize that Apple could switch suppliers at anytime or develop its own first-party components to replace third-party parts.

If that happens -- just as it recently did to GPU chip designer Imagination Technologies -- their shares could be crushed. Therefore, investors should carefully weigh those risks and rewards before investing in these top Apple suppliers. Apple: Huge Risk Of A Correction - How To Play It Shares are vulnerable to a selloff in the market and the stock is overvalued. How to play it.

Thesis:

There are risks to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock and the overall market.

As we see below, the market has had an incredible rally since the election. And as a leader of this run, Apple has rallied at an annualized rate of 137%. Both are vulnerable to an overdue correction. The risk/reward is unattractive for both in the near term.

Another leader of this market has been Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and it has fallen over $22 in the past 2 weeks alone. I believe investors should see the potential risk of the same thing happening to Apple. (And Goldman has fallen while the overall market has held steady.)

The market is overbought in the short term:

Since the election:

We've seen excessive returns since the election.

The rolling 3-month annualized return for the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is 23.71%. That's an incredible run. It's simply too far, too fast.

The VIX (NYSEARCA:VXX) return during that period is -85%. No fear. Investors are incredibly complacent.

Therefore, this is actually an attractive time to hedge long positions and lock in gains as we have come a long way and volatility is still inexpensive.

Apple Bull thesis is already priced in:

The good news on Apple is already priced in:

Analysts have become overwhelmingly bullish on the shares

The stock has run up in anticipation of the much hyped (109,00 mentions in Google) "supercycle" for iPhone sales.

The considerable risks to the stock at this level are described later, but have been completely ignored by recent valuation expansion.

SPY data by YCharts

Apple is incredibly overbought:

As we see from the graph, the outperformance is astounding. Apple has outperformed the market over the last 3 months by close to 6 times. And the annualized performance of 135%+ is exceptional even for the most strident bull.

Outperformance relative to the retail sector:

Again we see the incredible performance, but it is magnified when compared to the retail sector. Apple is a retailer that sells a technology product. So, the headwinds that affect retailers in general, could affect sales of iPads and iPhones. As we will discuss later, they have already had to discount iPads in order to reduce inventory.

I agree that a smartphone is a necessity. The issue is whether an upgrade is a necessity. And the retail customer is showing signs of fatigue from enormous debt expansion over the last few years, as will be discussed later.

AAPL 6 Month Price Returns Excluding Last Month (Daily) data by YCharts

Potential Risks:

The valuation and near-term performance ignores potential risks.

Consumer Debt:

Even though the demographics of the Apple customer and iPhone consumer suggest they are more educated and affluent than the general population, this customer is not immune from the pinch of higher interest rates and accumulated debt of the past 8 years.

In addition, it is unclear how the consumer will react as interest rates begin to rise after nearly a decade of easy money Federal Reserve monetary policy. The accumulated debt as we see is a threat to consumer spending and the overall market in the midterm and long term.

(via Federal Reserve)

Customer demand:

Customers are generally satisfied with their current models and could upgrade at lower levels than expected. As we see from current consumer debt levels in the previous graph, it is not unreasonable that consumers would consider delaying purchases in a rising interest rate environment.

Customers shrug at new models:

That level of satisfaction may be good for you, but it hasn't been great for the companies that make your phones. Their sales have leveled off or dropped as consumers, who have bought millions of phones in recent years, collectively shrug at new models that hardly seem a step above what they've already got in their hands. Among the top smartphones for customer satisfaction, Samsung's Galaxy Note 5 took first place with a grade of 86 ahead of Apple's iPhone 6S Plus, which scored 85. Samsung tied for third and fourth place with its Galaxy S6 Edge+ and Galaxy Note 4. Though companies such as Motorola and LG appeared on the list, Apple and Samsung dominated the top rankings among satisfied customers. (via CNET)

Slower growth:

Less affluent iPhone customers could simply postpone the upgrade decision entirely. Perhaps (3-5%) of users. This cost-conscious customer likely does not want to run the risk of loss and replacement of the AirPods and instead, would simply continue using current models longer than anticipated.

The net effect, would be a minor slowdown in growth for iPhone sales, but offset by higher revenues due to the replaced AirPods. As we saw, in product satisfaction surveys, customers are less impressed with newer models and do not see a large value-add in newer models. "Customers shrug at new models." (via CNET)

It is dangerous to assume that simply because customers have upgraded on a predictable timetable in the past, that they will continue to do so. At current valuation, shares include a premium of an expected upgrade cycle that could take longer than expected to materialize.

Valuation:

As we see below, the analyst consensus after many recent upgrades is only $148.71. So, the bullish scenario seems quite limited.

At a recent P/E multiple of 16, the shares trade at the high end of the 5-year range. Even a return to the recent P/E multiple of 14 and earnings forecasts for 2017 of $8.97 (Marketsmith) a share in a slow growth environment could leave the shares ~$126 or lower. The risk/reward then is $148 to the upside and $126 to the downside in the medium term.

AAPL data by YCharts

Company Growth:

A good example of the premium valuation juxtaposed with the slowing growth. In addition, we see the selloff from July 2015, where the shares had a significant correction.

AAPL Revenue (Annual YoY Growth) data by YCharts

Renewed Competition from Samsung:

Since Samsung had unprecedented problems with its last phone offering, it would be easy to discount them as a threat. Apple has benefited from Samsung's misfortune and that could be ending.

Product Risks:

AirPod adoption:

"No other Apple product in recent memory has been the source of so much hostility." (Wall Street Journal).

The new AirPods could be a risk to both the brand and sales. Lost AirPods will cost customers a "replacement fee" of $159 for the pair. This could upset customers and erode brand loyalty.

Apple's Penalty Charge For A Lost AirPod (via Forbes) Anyway, the running joke around the AirPods since they were announced was that Apple was going to be laughing all the way to the bank because of the high replacement costs when you lost a single AirPod. If you're looking for a single replacement AirPod, it's going to cost you $69. A replacement charging and case will also cost you $69. Apple: The Massive Gamble On AirPods

Slowing iPad sales: (via Recode)

Apple sold 13.3 million iPads, generating $5.5 billion in revenue. That represents a roughly 19 percent drop in units and a 22 percent drop in revenue from a year ago. And as recently as last week, Apple decided to cut the price on the iPad to $329 to clear out excess inventory, a clearance sale of sorts.

Apple Blinks On iPad - Announces Clearance Sale

Political Risk/Cash Repatriation:

The political purpose of repatriating cash is to create American manufacturing jobs. The significant question for shareholders is how does a de facto tax break for one of the richest companies in America to do a stock buyback help President Trump? It doesn't. In fact, a stock buyback is designed to benefit one group: shareholders. Large shareholders who now include outspoken critic of President Trump, Warren Buffett. This could be a negotiation, and potentially, a contentious one.

Potential Risks to my analysis: I would consider re-evaluating my view if more than one of these low probability events were to occur in the near term. However, in a market correction, the news would be largely ignored and the shares would be vulnerable anyway.

If the company were to announce a specific date for the return of their cash held overseas including a defined special dividend amount or defined buyback.

a defined special dividend amount or defined buyback. Unexpectedly large iPhone sales in China (above 80M).

Unexpectedly favorable customer adoption of "AirPods."

Market View:

This is still a bull market. And Apple is one of the leading stocks. If we enter a correction, the downside is significant. But, it is a bull market until proven otherwise. I expect these strategies to be very successful if we enter a correction and be mostly successful otherwise.

When a market leader corrects:

Even if we were to have a garden variety correction in a bull market, the shares could be very vulnerable. The shares have fared better than other recent leaders like Goldman Sachs, which has recently fallen from $250 to around $225. However, this illustrates how quickly gains can evaporate.

Goldman: The Run Is Fading, How To Play It

Technical Overview:

AAPL data by YCharts

Higher share prices on lower volume is very bearish. It indicates that institutions are less willing to pay up in price to make new purchases.

In addition, the shares are now above the higher Bollinger Band signaling and in an overbought situation. This makes the setup for these trades very attractive.

How to play it:

Bullish shareholder:

A shareholder who wants protection from a down move.

I would sell a vertical call in May: (this is not a naked position)

Sell: May 5 $142 Calls for $4.63

Buy: May 5 $149 Calls for $1.58

Premium collected: $3.05

This brings in $3.05 of protection on the downside.

If one is very concerned about the stock, I would use some of the credit received to buy the May $140 put for $2.13.

As a trade to participate on the downside:

Buy Vertical Put Spread

Buy: May 5 $139 Puts $1.86

Sell: May 5 $134 Puts .85

Net Cost: $1.01

Break-Even: $137.64

At $134, the position would be worth $3.99 or a return of 395% on a modest 6.9% decline in the shares.

Conclusion:

Apple has been a leader in this market and has priced in very bullish scenarios. However, the risk to the shares is that the valuation is stretched, retail is vulnerable, the market is vulnerable, and the shares could have a selloff similar to that of former leader, Goldman Sachs. At a minimum, a pullback is warranted. Investors would be wise to protect their gains and traders have the potential to profit from this favorable scenario.

Apple stock continues to hover close to all-time highs as analysts try to paint an even rosier picture than what they ve already sketched for investors. It seems like a broken record these days: the iPhone 8 will be so spectacular that no one will care about any other smartphone again  ever.

Although no one seems to really care about what Apple is doing currently, as all eggs are being placed in the iPhone 8 basket, the company announced today that it will release its next earnings report on May 2. The report will be followed by the earnings call, which will stream online at 5 p.m. Eastern. The company has guided for $51.5 billion to $53.5 billion in sales and a gross margin of 38% to 39%, not that the March quarter even seems to matter to most analysts or even investors at this point.

Underestimating the iPhone 8?

Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri said this week that investors are greatly underestimating how big the iPhone 8 cycle will be this year. That seems hard to believe, given that analysts have excited investors so much that they re pushing Apple stock to a new record on a regular basis these days.

Nonetheless, Arcuri told CNBC s Squawk on the Street on Monday that the 82 million-unit consensus Wall Street has set for this year s holiday quarter iPhone sales isn t high enough. As countless others have noted, he explained that the iPhone installed base is 50% bigger than the base the iPhone 6 launched into, so even if the upgrade rate is far lower, the end unit number should be much bigger.

The Cowen analyst believes that there s still  a ton of innovation  left in the iPhone and predicts a foldable iPhone by 2019.

But will people really buy a $1,000 iPhone 8?

One of the rumors about the iPhone 8 has been that it could be priced in excess of $1,000, but UBS analyst Steven Milunovich doesn t buy it. He predicts that the 64GB anniversary iPhone will be priced between $850 and $900, which is only slightly higher than the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus. He noted that the S8 Plus has a 6.2-inch display, while the iPhone 8 is rumored to have a 5.8-inch display. He feels that this limits how much Apple can charge for it.

He also believes that Apple is  about mainstream luxury,  so he just doesn t feel that a $1,000 phone is likely.

A limit on upside for Apple stock?

Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves also weighed in on Apple stock today, boosting his price target to $150 from $140 per share as he found signs of strong component orders, which caused him to raise his iPhone unit estimates. Even with the price target increase, he seems to see limited room left for further upside in Apple stock.

He also warned that a strong iPhone 8 cycle may not be enough to drive Apple stock much further up from where it is now. He expects future growth to  slow substantially  and believes that corporate tax reform and a dividend increase could be needed for  significant  upside in Apple stock.

Shares of Apple stock edged upward by as much as 0.53% to $144.46 during regular trading hours on Tuesday. Technology Companies Leading The Way; Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com ... Technology Companies Leading The Way Within The Industry

Stocks Mentioned: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com inc. (NYSE:CRM), TEXTMUNICATION HLD COM NPV(OTCMKTS:TXHD)

The space for technology has grown by leaps and bounds since the creation of the internet. New ways of communicating have gone from a simple telephone call to now multiple ways of communication through chat rooms, direct messages, and even text communication. According to the research consultancy IDC, the global information technology (IT) industry market, encompassing hardware, software, services, and telecommunications, is expected to reach $3.8 trillion in 2016, up from $3.7 trillion the previous year.

There is a broad range of technology companies in the industry. One of the most popular is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), most known for its software and hardware. Apple is one of today s top trending technology companies. Consumers can use Apple s smartwatch, which was created to communicate through text messages and phone calls. The company posted quarterly revenue of $46.9 billion and quarterly net income of $9 billion, or $1.67 per diluted share in 2016.

salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is leading the way in enterprise cloud services. This $3 billion technology communications company has made the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) market relevant to businesses of all types and sizes, reshaping enterprise communication in the process. Salesforce also announced a partnership with Hewlett-Packard to develop a  Superpod  that will provide dedicated infrastructure for large customers to run Salesforce in the cloud.

These companies have grown substantially in the technology industry. TEXTMUNICATION HLD COM NPV (OTCMKTS:TXHD) is following in their footsteps. Textmunication is an online mobile marketing platform service that will connect merchants with their customers and allow them to drive loyalty and repeat business in a non-intrusive, value added medium. For merchants Textmunication provides a mobile marketing platform where they can always send the most up-to-date offers/discounts/alerts/events schedule, such as happy hours, trivia night, and other campaigns. The consumer can also access specials and promotions that merchants choose to distribute through Textmunication by opting in to keywords designated to the merchants keywords. This allows consumers to take their information wherever they go and learn about the latest buzz as soon as they are available, providing the consumer to receive the events, deals, and messages on their cellphone via SMS messaging.

While Textmunication is not as widely known as some other companies yet, it is important to look at where those other companies came from. This company is unique in its kind and has lots of potential for growth. Textmunication could have already set a clear pathway for success and may continue moving forward in that direction. Why A Premium TV Bundle Could Be Apple's Secret Weapon By doing this, Apple would also be taking aim at a more niche area than any of its rivals have attempted which may give them a competitive advantage.

While that type of package isn t ground-breaking in itself, the impact of it on the various cable/satellite companies is sizable enough for investors to take notice.

Apple is reportedly trying a new approach which will offer just the big three pay-cable premium channels in one bundle pack.

Apple has long been rumored to enter the streaming TV/skinny bundle space but has not been able to gain solid traction.

And here we go again.

As any investor in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) knows (by now), the company REALLY REALLY wants to be in the TV space. They can play coy all they want, but at this point, it's as sure as death, taxes and a new iPhone coming out every year that Apple wants to make a splash in this sector.

While reported meetings with networks haven't panned out and alternative methods to lure consumers (i.e. Virtual TV Guide) haven't been met with the same level of excitement, Apple hasn't given up. Yet its team clearly knows nothing will match the idea of streaming (potentially) a skinny bundle.

Well that in the traditional form is still seemingly a ways off.

However, according to Re/Code, the executives over at Apple may have another idea in mind and it's an interesting play. Reports have surfaced Apple now wants to do a premium skinny bundle that consists solely of HBO, Showtime and Starz.

Effectively, the big three of pay-TV.

Apple is rumored to be in the process of talking to the three channels' parent companies (AT&T (NYSE:T)/Time Warner (NYSE:TWX), CBS (NYSE:CBS) and Lions Gate (NYSE:LGF.A) (NYSE:LGF.B)) with the idea of unifying them in a power package. Currently, each has its own streaming service and you can access all three via Apple TV; however, this would be the first time you could unite them in one app for one price.

Doesn't really sound like anything groundbreaking right? Except that's kind of the point.

Apple is doing this because if successful it could change the playing field in a couple of different ways. First, it presents a new option that subscribers could be interested in purchasing. At present, HBO Now runs $14.99 a month, Showtime is cheaper at $10.99 and Starz is comparatively a steal at $8.99. That's about $35 total if all were bought separate and if that total price could come down a little, the triple-package could be more appealing to TV viewers.

There's also a bigger plan at play here as Apple is likely looking to send a message to the industry. Keep in mind cable/satellite subscribers usually can't just outright buy a channel like HBO; they have to be a subscriber to a package of channels and then add-on a premium network.

This is cutting out the middle man and that makes it more appealing. If Apple is successful here what that does is it slowly takes a little bit of power away from the cable/satellite companies - not a ton, but enough that it chips away at an already delicate position. This would set a new precedent that would force providers to again re-think its strategy and be a new enticement to would-be cord-cutters to make the leap.

The premium bundle approach is also smart as it would position Apple OUTSIDE of the other players in a very competitive space. I've personally lost count of the number of streaming/skinny bundles out there and that's not even including upcoming plays from Hulu, YouTube and now potentially even Verizon (NYSE:VZ). What I saw is that nobody is directly targeting these specific subscribers outside of the networks themselves, which makes this an interesting niche approach.

Again, it's nothing fancy and it won't bring the cable/satellite companies to its collective knees, but it makes a point, and that should be of particular interest to investors, and not just investors of Apple. If I was a shareholder in AT&T (or Time Warner), I would think long and hard about which outcome I'd be pulling for here.

The tricky part of this deal is that for it to be successful, ALL three parent companies would need to agree as just having two of the three doesn't have the same appeal. If I'm AT&T, which owns its own satellite company and streaming service and is about to own HBO outright, you may want to think this through a little more. This type of package may not fully rival what DirecTV Now is selling, but it is close enough to give a little pause.

What investors should like about this approach is how different it seems to be in concept. Apple is doing what it does best and re-imagining the field to a way it hasn't seen and in a way it thinks it can win with in the long run. Often that is done by taking risks and while the risk here is minimal, the reward is more far-reaching.

Now again, nothing has been confirmed (as always is the case with Apple), but when a site like Re/Code goes out with information like this, investors need to pay attention. This is an area Apple has long been enamored with and clearly the company shows no signs of giving up. Shareholders know what Apple has done to the music industry and if it can mimic that with TV, then it will continue to remain even more profitable.

The thing to remember here is that Apple's ultimate endgame is content. It wants to have a Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) like service where it can put out its own series. Currently, that is already happening through Apple Music, but there's a longer game at play, and as we are continuing to learn - it just keeps getting more interesting.

BMO Bullish on 2 Apple Suppliers But Lowers a 3rd Investment firm BMO Capital Markets hiked its price target on semiconductor stocks Skyworks Solutions Inc. (SWKS) and Qorvo Inc. (QRVO) while reducing its valuation on shares of user-interface technology company Synaptics Inc. (SYNA).

Of upside to chipmakers Skyworks and Qorvo, BMO analyst Ambrish Srivastava noted that  the wireless handset supply chain appears fairly robust to us   And as we head into what should be the sweet spot of builds for handsets, particularly for Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Samsung, we believe the shares of the two of their major suppliers in our coverage, Qorvo and Skyworks, should continue to see valuation support at current levels vs. our initial thinking. 

The BMO analyst lifted Qorvo s price target from $57 to $67 and Skyworks fro $81 to $98, indicating an approximate 1.5% downside and 0.3% upside respectively. Closing down about 0.7% at a price of $68.05 on Monday, Qorvo s shares reflect a 34% year-over-year (YOY) gain. Shares of Woburn, Mass.-based Skyworks, closing at $97.72 on Monday, indicate a 26% increase over the same period.

Concern Over Synaptics

BMO remains concerned over San Jose, Calif.-based Synaptics  position with Apple, indicating that the interface firm needs to regain investor confidence. As a result, Srivastava cut his price target on SYNA shares from $60 to $53, indicated an 8.6% upside from the stock s closing price of $48.80 on Monday.

 We continue to see challenges for the company s business, particularly in DDIC (display driver integrated circuit) at its major customer Apple, as the (smartphone) lineup expands beyond those with LCD screens,  wrote the BMO analyst.

Srivastava reiterated market perform ratings on all three of the U.S.-based Apple suppliers  stocks. (See also: 3 Chipmakers That Are Tied to Apple s iPhone.) Forget Apple. Xiaomi CEO Now Wants to Be More Like Costco Xiaomi Corp. says it s misunderstood. Once compared with Apple Inc. for its sleek smartphones and charismatic leadership, the Chinese startup is seeking an image makeover as it tries to recover from a sales-growth slide.

And the brand its billionaire co-founder Lei Jun wants to be compared with: Costco Wholesale Corp., the Issaquah, Washington-based warehouse retailer that sells everything from wine and diamond rings to bulging boxes of cereal and fruit at knockdown prices. Xiaomi s revenue will probably reach $15 billion this year as the Beijing-based maker of products ranging from pens and air purifiers to TVs and smartphones adopts a new business model and fine-tunes operations, Lei, 47, said in a recent interview.

Lei Jun Photographer: Dhiraj Singh/Bloomberg

 We are not Apple,  Lei, clad in a black polo shirt and blue jeans, said at Xiaomi s Bengaluru office in India, its biggest overseas market.  We have the same value system as Costco. We want users to enjoy better products at an affordable price. 

While Apple commands premium prices and enjoys the highest margins in the brutally competitive $425 billion global smartphone industry, Costco sells merchandise at razor-thin profits while fueling earnings from its 35 million annual memberships. As Xiaomi embraces a new strategy to fuel growth, Lei s goal is to pull in more revenue from apps and services, which delivered $1 billion in sales from 10 million-plus monthly active users last year.

It s a far different strategy than the one it used to claim the top spot among China s smartphone makers and a valuation of $45 billion that made it, briefly, the most valuable startup in the world. Instead of the online flash sales and inexpensively-sourced components that it used to disrupt the mobile industry, Lei wants to bring internet-inspired efficiency to offline commerce. He s also turning to India to revive Xiaomi s fortunes as China grows more competitive.

 Make History

Dozens of circular mobiles swing from the lights, with phrases encouraging staff to  Let s make history together.  A scattering of motivational cartoons sketched on whiteboards promote Xiaomi s aims and achievements. Now six years old, Xiaomi s meteoric rise has been usurped in recent quarters by competitors replicating -- and succeeding at -- the very model that enabled it to vault ahead of Apple and Samsung Electronics Co. in its home market.

The risk for Xiaomi in India is that it will go the same way as China: toppled by rival brands such as Oppo, Huawei and Vivo.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

Tarun Pathak, associate director at Counterpoint Research, said Xiaomi is taking a risky approach. The company s rivals have been able to sell the same number of phones in India, even though their products cost as much as three times more. As Xiaomi seeks to expand sales volumes, it will have to sell more of its high-end models.  Their margins are thin and when they go offline, their expenses will shoot up,  he said.

Modi Meeting

During his third visit to India -- a week-long trip that included a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- Lei summoned a town hall-style staff meeting to rally a team he praised for making Xiaomi the No. 1 online-selling smartphone company in the country the past two quarters. Their goal now, he said, was to the cement that position in the next three to five years.

In India,  incomes are low and everyone wants good products,  Lei said in a glass-walled conference room, flanked by several of his top executives. Lei is trying to reignite the buzz in the offline or  new retail  market, he said.  Everyone realizes the online market is very limited. 

In China, Xiaomi accounts for only a 10th of total smartphone sales, Lei estimates, leaving bigger opportunities in the traditional bricks-and-mortar approach. Lei aims to have 1,000 so-called MiHome retail stores with sales topping $10 billion annually in next three years, he said.

MiHome stores will offer just two dozen Xiaomi products, according to Lei. Pointing to a single line of $1 apiece writing pens, two types of air purifiers, and three kinds of smartphones, he says he envisages selling no more than 100 product types in coming years, versus the hundreds, or even thousands of stock-keeping units maintained by some manufacturers.

New Beginning?

 Our toughest times have passed starting this year, and our main strategy now is to bring the internet way of thinking to offline in China,  Lei said. The plan is to integrate multiple links in offline commerce and avoid the bottlenecks that can occur as products move along the supply chain through manufacturing and repair to logistics and sales.

But even the  new retail  strategy risks being copied. Lei spoke publicly about it one morning and the head of an e-retailing behemoth used the same term hours later, he said. Competitors have in the past paid the ultimate price of copying Xiaomi s approach, Lei said, declining to give names.  One company lost $1 billion last year, maybe even more,  he said.  Game over. 

Microsoft Rival

Lei s ideas were shaped by past ventures. He previously ran Kingsoft Corp., a software maker that competes with Microsoft Corp. s enterprise software sales in China, and his e-commerce company Joyo.com was acquired by Amazon.com Inc. and renamed Amazon China. Lei is convinced his retail plan will revive the growth prospects that helped earn Xiaomi its lofty valuation.

Sales began to stagnate in 2015 and shipments plummeted in China last year, with the company refusing to release 2016 numbers. In January, former international head Hugo Barra left for Facebook Inc., raising questions about Xiaomi s ability to navigate its way through what Lei had described as  unforgettable  challenges.

In India last week, Lei insisted that revenue never slowed during the past two years, and that  Xiaomi has resumed rapid growth.  Suggestions that the company s value had sunk to $4 billion  hurt us a lot,  he said, refusing to be drawn into a discussion on its current value.

 It was never as bad as it was made out to be,  he said.  Our investors are not worried. I have explained to them clearly. And to our users, we say,  It takes 10 to 15 years. We need time. Trust Mr. Lei.  

Enough Cash

There is no pressure on cash flow and no need to raise funds, he said, adding:  We have more than enough cash.  Lei declined to comment on whether Xiaomi has any immediate plan for an initial public offering. Right now, he s focusing on India, including the potential to open physical stores in the nation with the world s largest youth population.

Xiaomi is planning a third factory in India, where Lei says he s prepared to take more risks, including doubling investments to $1 billion over the next few years.

 In the next two years, we want more and more influence in India,  Lei said. How he will do that plays on his mind constantly he says, as he reaches for a black backpack and fishes for one of 10 phones inside.

 I keep thinking about how to perfect my products,  Lei says, clutching a phone with a metallic, pale blue finish.  For instance, how come Indians don t like this  Tiffany blue  colored phone? 

That s just one of many things that perplexes Lei about the India market. But he s determined to figure it out:  This is what keeps me awake at night.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Build Multi-Level Store in Mexico: Report Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is enjoying its success in Mexico. The Cupertino-based tech giant is reportedly planning to build a second brick-and-mortar retail store in the country.

To meet the growing demand in Mexico, Apple will build a new multi-level flagship in Mexico City s upscale Polanco district, Apple Insider reported, citing a person familiar with the company s plans.

According to the person who wanted to remain unidentified, Apple has inked the lease to the second location in Ciudad de Mexico (CDMX).

The interior design of the new store is expected to be similar to that of Apple s World Trade Center store in New York City, the person said.

 A timeline for completion is not currently known, but the existing Mexico City store has experienced unusually high consumer sales and enterprise services revenues,  the publication reported citing the unnamed person.

Apple Expanding Latin America Presence

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) opened its first retail store in Mexico in September last year.

In addition to its stores in Mexico, Apple also operates two brick-and-mortar outlets in Brazil. Rumors suggest that the company is planning to open additional outlets in the country.

Meanwhile, the tech giant is looking to open stores in Argentina. According to the reports, the iPhone maker might open its first Argentinian store in Buenos Aires in 2018.

Apple has nearly 500 retail stores across 19 countries. In addition to Latin America, the company is also looking to open retail stores in India. Apple s retail expansion into Latin America and Asia is being fueled by the need to generate revenue hurt by the company s poor performance in China. The company has been facing problem in China, which is the company s second-largest market after the United States.

Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) have been performing well so far this year. The stock is up nearly 24% year-to-date. During the last 12 months, AAPL has surged nearly 32%.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. Malware Targeting Apple Inc. Devices Is Surging Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) laptops and desktops have long been known for being less susceptible to viruses and malware than their Windows-based counterparts, but it appears that advantage could be waning.

That s according to a new report from a security firm that indicated a surge in malware specifically targeting Macs last year. Fortune has some details on the development:

Security firm McAfee released a report this week that showed a big jump in 2016 regarding malware hitting the Mac operating system. The McAfee report said there were 460,000 malware instances affecting the Mac OS in the fourth quarter of 2016, an over 700% jump from the previous year during the same quarter.

That s a massive jump, and confirms similar reports from other researchers in recent years. Hackers are increasingly targeting Mac computers as Apple chips away at Microsoft s longstanding market share dominance. More Mac computers in use simply means more opportunities to infect unsuspecting users.

Mac users probably shouldn t panic, however. McAfee s report notes that  the big increase in Mac OS malware was due to adware bundling,  referring to unwanted ad-serving software that s often unknowingly included with third party software. Users can protect against these sorts of infections simply by only installing apps directly from Apple s App Store, since those apps are already screened for adware and malware before inclusion in the store.

Adware is also not nearly as dangerous as malware and viruses. Generally, adware is easily removed by uninstalling the program.

Apple Inc. shares closed at $143.34 on Friday, down $0.32 (-0.22%). Year-to-date, AAPL has gained 24.30%, versus a 5.68% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

AAPL currently has a StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 27 stocks in the Technology   Hardware category. Apple Reigns as DJIA's Best Performing Stock of 2017 Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) dipped 32 cents last week (about 0.2%), closing at $143.34 on Friday. The stock posted a new 52-week high on Wednesday.

But the company remains the best-performing stock by a wide margin among the 30 equities that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The company s stock is up 23.76% year to date, well above Boeing s 14.88% improvement.

The week started out with an announcement from Imagination Technologies that Apple will cut its ties with the U.K.-based company within the next 15 to 24 months. The company supplies the graphics processing unit (GPU) for Apple products, and the London-traded company said that Apple  has asserted  that it is developing its own graphics design technology  in order to control its products  and that Apple will  be reducing its future reliance  on Imagination s technology.

That was bad news for the U.K. company and not especially interesting news for Apple investors who moved the stock up just 4 cents on the day of the announcement.

Later in the week reports surfaced that the next iPhone would not ship on time. The first report blamed difficulties in manufacturing the curved glass OLED display and the second report noted challenges to the development of the device s 3D sensing technology.

Apple shares closed at $143.34 on Friday in a 52-week range of $89.47 to $145.46. The consensus 12-month price target is $147.61 in a price target range of $102 to $185 per share. Apple lover's biggest win: Beating iPhone BEIJING   Duan Yongping is convinced Tim Cook didn't have a clue who he was when they first met a couple years ago. The Apple boss probably does now.

Duan is the reclusive billionaire who founded Oppo and Vivo, the twin smartphone brands that dealt the world's largest company a stinging defeat in China last year. Once derided as cheap iPhone knockoffs, they leapfrogged the rankings and shoved Apple Inc. out of the top three in 2016   when iPhone shipments fell in China for the first time.

They managed to do it because the American smartphone giant didn't adapt to local competition, the entrepreneur told Bloomberg in what he said was his first interview in 10 years. Oppo and Vivo employed tactics Apple was reluctant to match, such as cheaper devices with high-end features, for fear of jeopardizing its winning formula elsewhere, Duan said.

 Apple couldn't beat us in China because even they have flaws,  the 56-year-old electronics mogul said.  They're maybe too stubborn sometimes. They made a lot of great things, like their operating system, but we surpass them in other areas. 

That's not to say Duan doesn't appreciate the iPhone maker's global clout. In fact, the billionaire's obsession with his U.S. rival is legion: he's long been a big-time investor in Apple and an unabashed fan of its chief executive officer.

 I've met Tim Cook on several occasions. He might not know me, but we've chatted a little,  Duan said.  I like him a lot. 

Apple couldn't confirm Duan's meeting with Cook when contacted by Bloomberg. But Duan has blogged incessantly about Apple's products, share price and operations since 2013, when the company was worth half what it is today. He needs  a really big pocket  because he carries four devices, including a heavily used iPhone. In a 2015 post, he argued Apple's profit should reach $100 billion within five years.

Today, Duan won't say when he actually bought in but says much of his overseas wealth remains tied up in the iPhone maker. He even lives in Palo Alto, California, an easy drive from Apple's new UFO-like headquarters in Cupertino, California.

 Apple is an extraordinary company. It is a model for us to learn from,  Duan said.  We don't have the concept of surpassing anyone. The focus instead is to improve ourselves. 

Oppo's gains against Apple may now earn an even broader following for the billionaire dubbed China's Warren Buffett by local media for his investment acumen. Born in Jiangxi, a birthplace of Mao Zedong's Communist revolution, Duan began his career at a state-run vacuum tube plant before making his name with homegrown electronics.

Duan left the factory floor around 1990, when China was just embracing capitalism and opening industries to private investment. He headed to southern China's Guangdong province, then the cradle of liberal reforms, to run a struggling electronics plant.

His first product was the Subor gaming console with dual-cartridge slots   a direct shot at Nintendo Co.'s classic Family Computer, known elsewhere as the Nintendo Entertainment System. The 100- to 400-yuan Subor became a hit in the absence of local competitors. Duan even enlisted Kung Fu star Jackie Chan to endorse the device. By 1995, revenue from the Subor exceeded 1 billion yuan.

Duan left to set up a new business that year as the operation flourished   a pattern he would repeat in later years.

He christened his second venture Bubugao, literally  rising higher step-by-step.  BBK, as the company came to be known, created a popular line of VCD and MP3 players but later also made DVD players for global brands. Subsidiary Bubugao Communication Equipment Co. became one of the country's biggest feature-phone makers around 2000, going head-to-head with Nokia and Motorola.

It was the first iPhone in 2007 that paved the way for Oppo and Vivo. While they share a common founder in Duan, the sister brands are fierce competitors, trotting out dueling marketing campaigns in markets from India to Southeast Asia. Their salesmanship philosophy plays well in emerging markets, IDC research manager Kiranjeet Kaur said.

 The companies fully understand how to make the best of their people, a specialty they inherited from Duan,  said Nicole Peng, a senior director at research firm Canalys.

Importantly, they understood their millennial audience.  Many of their managers are young and have been working at the company since graduation,  she said.

Duan's latest endeavors were, in part, dreamed up in Apple's backyard. By 2001 at the age of 40, Duan had decided to move to California to focus on investment and philanthropy, later installing his family in a mansion he reportedly bought from Cisco Systems Inc. Chairman John Chambers. But the advent of the smartphone forced the entrepreneur out of retirement.

By the second half of 2000s, BBK was on the verge of falling apart as sales of its basic devices slowed.

 We were in serious discussions about how to close the company peacefully   in a way that the employees can leave unhurt and suppliers don't lose money,  he said.

Those intense brainstorming sessions spawned the two businesses that would go on to embody Duan's greatest success.

In 2005, the entrepreneur and his prot g  Tony Chen decided to create a new company. Dubbed Oppo, it sold music players but ramped up to smartphones in 2011. In 2009, BBK itself created Vivo, headed by another of Duan's disciples, Shen Wei.

 Making mobile phones was not my call,  Duan said.  But I reckoned we could do well in this market. 

At first, neither label garnered much attention. The iPhone was captivating users with its revolutionary apps system and elegant interface, while BlackBerrys lorded over the corporate market.

But Oppo and Vivo then developed a marketing-blitz approach that relied on local celebrity endorsement and a vast resellers' store network across China. They crafted an affordable image that appealed to a millennial crowd, then tricked out their de vices with high-end specs. On the surface, Oppo and Vivo phones now routinely surpass the iPhone on measures such as charging speeds, memory and battery life.

It paid off. The duo together shipped more than 147 million smartphones in China in 2016, dwarfing Apple's 44.9 million, IDC estimates. Oppo and Vivo both doubled their 2015 haul. Their approach worked particularly well in lower-tier cities, where mid-range phones became a mainstream hit, said Tay Xiaohan, an IDC analyst.

Duan's smartphone progeny are also gaining some momentum beyond their home turf. About a quarter of Oppo's shipments went to markets like India, where it hopes to dig in before Apple establishes a meaningful presence.

One thing's for sure, Duan doesn't see himself returning to an active executive, leaving others to deal with the next challenge.

 I've made it clear many years ago, I will never make a comeback,  he said.  If there's a problem they can't fix, then neither can I.

Does This New Apple Inc. iMac Rumor Make Sense? Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)-centric website MacRumors recently reported on a recent post in blog Pike's Universum, in which a purported list of specifications/upgrades for Apple's next-generation iMacs -- which the blog says will be coming in "late October" -- is provided. Though you can see the full specification list here, there's one part of the specification list that's worth doing a sanity check on -- the main processor.

No more Core processors for the iMac?

Apple's iMac computers have traditionally used chip-giant Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Core processor family. Today, Apple's iMacs can be configured with Intel's Core i5 chips, the middle-of-the-pack within Intel's Core processor lineup, or Core i7 chips, the cream of the crop.

This new rumor claims that, instead of using Intel's Core chips, Apple will use Intel's Xeon E3 processors. Despite the fancy-sounding name, Intel's Xeon E3 chips are little more than Intel's Core processors with a few additional capabilities enabled -- namely, support for ECC memory and vPro technology.

ECC memory -- ECC stands for "error correcting code" -- is a type of memory that, according to memory maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU), includes capabilities designed for "detecting and correcting single-bit memory errors." "By detecting and correcting single-bit errors, ECC server memory helps preserve the integrity of your data, prevent data corruption, and prevent system crashes and failures," Micron's webpage explains.

I suspect that, if Apple really does shift its iMac line to Xeon E3 processors and away from Intel's traditional Core processors, it would be doing the shift mainly for ECC memory support.

Does this make sense?

If Apple's goal is to position the iMac -- and indeed, the Mac itself -- as a "professional" platform, then the use of Xeon E3 processors with ECC memory makes perfect sense. Apple already uses Intel Xeon E5 processors coupled with ECC memory in its Mac Pro line, so it's not as though use of such technologies would be unprecedented.

What's worth noting, though, is that, while the use of Xeon E3 processors with ECC memory may appeal to professionals and prosumers, these features don't really buy the average consumer much. In fact, Apple will almost certainly have to jack up prices on its ECC-capable iMac computers to compensate for what are likely to be higher memory prices.

So, does Apple force all potential iMac buyers to eat the costs of more expensive memory? Or does Apple simply offer "Core" options and "Xeon" options? Given how pricey Apple's iMac computers tend to be anyway -- and the supply-chain complexity of supporting too many computer models -- Apple may simply bet that its customer base won't mind a modest price increase due to the slightly pricier memory, and go all-in on Xeon.

Foolish takeaway

If Apple's goal is to position its Mac products as true "professional" products, while pushing more consumption-oriented consumers over to its iPad product line, then a move to Xeon-based iMacs (and MacBook Pros) with ECC memory support may be the right way to go. Apple may find that Xeon processors -- by their server/workstation heritage -- are more marketable to the professional/prosumer crowd, and even "regular" consumers might be enticed by the fact that, when they buy an Apple product, they get a Xeon processor rather than a "pedestrian" Core processor.

I have no idea if this rumor is true, but it's certainly plausible. Who Loses If Apple Inc. Goes In-House With Chips? (AAPL) As of last Friday s close, Imagination Technologies   the semiconductor company responsible for the striking graphics of Apple Inc. s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) phones, tablets and watches   was worth more than $270 per share. Flash forward not even a week, and shares of the London-based tech company are barely hanging onto triple digits.

As you perhaps guessed, Apple is indeed to blame.

In most mobile devices, graphics processing is integrated within something that s called a  system on a chip  application processor. Semiconductor companies like Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD ), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC ), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA ) and Qualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM ) own the designs for both the graphics components and computing components of such chips.

Apple, on the other hand, own most of its SoCs, from the Ax series in your iPhone to the Sx series in your Apple Watch. But for its phones, tablets and TV, Apple buys the intellectual property for the GPU from Imagination Technologies   or at least it used it. Now, Tim Cook & Co. have decided they want to make and own their own GPUs for all mobile devices.

Apple was once considering buying Imagination Technologies to this end, but has simply announced abandonment instead. Hence, the plummet for Imagination, which gets over half its revenue from the iPhone king.

Naturally, Imagination Technologies is a little upset and has already more than hinted this news is fertile ground for a lawsuit.

 Apple has not presented any evidence to substantiate its assertion that it will no longer require Imagination s technology, without violating Imagination s patents, intellectual property and confidential information. This evidence has been requested by Imagination but Apple has declined to provide it,  it said in a statement.

But a lawsuit between Apple and Imagination Technologies is a David-and-Goliath battle if I ve ever seen one. Apple (like most tech companies) is no stranger to such conflicts and has plenty of cash to settle and move on.

Meanwhile, the desire to control the IP for its GPU is more than logical considering graphics are the key to everything from machine learning to augmented reality. This is especially true, as Wired noted, because Apple is playing catch-up in those areas.

Next Page Can Apple Double Its Service Business By 2020? The SOTP analysis is more illustrative in nature, as we continue to reiterate our $156 price target.

When modeling Apple Pay revenue ramp, the business may contribute an incremental $1.8 billion, which brings Apple within the ballpark of doubling the entire business segment by FY'20.

Apple may need to supplement these efforts with M&A, though effectiveness in terms of value addition is subjective at best.

While the topic of services revenue may have gotten a little stale when pertaining to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). I think it's worth re-examining whether there's any merit in service/app revenue expansion given the availability of more exhaustive data on margins/revenue segmentation from the business segment.

Now, obviously, Tim Cook has moved the investor focus towards software/service revenue given the more attractive margins, and reduced CapEx needs with the exception of Apple iCloud, which is very datacenter/storage intensive.

Furthermore, Apple's stock price continues to move higher in anticipation of a super-cycle (refresh driven demand given aged iPhone, Mac, and iPad installed based), but whether Apple can sustain enviable margins/revenue over a multi-year trajectory is more contingent on service/software revenue ramp, as it's a higher margin category.

So, what's new?

In the past month, the analysts at RBC Capital Markets released a research note that classifies the revenue derived from Apple's non-hardware business units and the relative profit contribution of the separate business units. I discuss Amit Daryanani's latest research notes in more detail here.

Source: RBC Capital Markets

Now, keep in mind, Apple Music Revenue is growing at a fairly rapid pace, which is helping to offset the iTunes unit decline. Now, obviously Apple was late to market when releasing Apple Music, as competitors were thoroughly entrenched (Pandora (NYSE:P) and Spotify (Private:MUSIC)).

However, the strength of Apple's user ecosystem, and its ability to attract exclusive music contracts with various record studios helped to differentiate the app. Notwithstanding, management's efforts in Apple-branded software should be watched closely, as the release of new applications will sustain the current revenue CAGR. More specifically, the introduction of new hardware categories increases Apple Care revenue, heightened storage attach rates (thus increasing app store volumes), and emerging categories like car infotainment/ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems).

That being the case, Apple needs to devise a strategy for ramping its mobile payment efforts. The adoption of mobile payment terminals, and the buildout of the corresponding payment ecosystem has been slow, as is the case with anything pertaining to banking.

As a general rule of thumb, I believe mobile payments could become Apple's largest software/business category given enough time, as banking services while slow to reach mass market adoption has the most defensible barrier to entry given network effect, and consumer dependence on banking/payment services.

I explain this in greater detail here, but here's a brief excerpt on my commentary pertaining to Apple Pay from last year:

To put Apple's progress in comparison, after roughly a year into its launch, the company generated $10.9 billion in annual transactional volume, according to Timetric. The average transaction amount was $44.54 (what Visa reported in its most recent quarter), which translates to 244.723 million Apply Pay transactions in the prior year. To put this in perspective, it took the financial industry 40 years to reach a comparable transaction volume figure (rough approximation) for debit/credit cards combined.

I believe Apple's technical adoption curve was relatively quick in comparison to the timescale of original cashless payment services. Hence, the rate of annualized growth, and the relative penetration rate across the bank/merchant processor ecosystem will move at a much quicker pace, substantiating a multi-decade investment thesis pertaining specifically to Apple Pay, and is perhaps the one x factor that gives Apple's claims of doubling its service segment revenue by FY'20 any legitimacy.

Of course, Apple needs to transition towards being a strategic player in mobile payments, as Visa (NYSE:V)/MasterCard (NYSE:MA) are the primary payment network providers for all transactions done digitally. If Apple were to devise some back-end payment network improvements by also operating as a digital clearing house for transactions, via the open-ledger system used primarily for cryptocurrencies (i.e. Bitcoin), Apple could move further up the value chain, and increase its transaction spread across its installed base of mobile payment users.

Now, keep in mind, the two most profitable app/service categories is Apple Store and Apple Pay. Hence, Apple's execution as an ecosystem provider has been great, but their efforts in mobile payments leave much to be desired. While, I can acknowledge that Apple is in the early innings of driving adoption, and payment volumes have been ramping, the need for innovation/platform impact has never been more important. The investor perception must shift from hardware to software if Apple wants to sustain a much higher value premium, which I explain in greater detail.

With the introduction of EMV cards by the major banks, we're witnessing a short-term solution for analog card readers, but I think the entire ecosystem will start shifting towards mobile payments.

Generally speaking, the EMV cards while more secure than magnetic strip are also more of a hassle to use at payment/checkout. Hence, the development of more secure transaction settlement tends to result in longer payment/checkout times when purchasing product/services at brick-and-mortar locations.

Furthermore, the implied volume ramp seems fairly conservative, but net revenue contribution is quite difficult to derive from the transaction volume figure, as Apple Pay is monetized on a per-transaction basis.

Even so, we can derive a net revenue figure from the information supplied by RBC Capital Markets, by simply dividing the payment volume by the average transaction amount for debit/credit cards, which is already disclosed by both Visa and MasterCard.

As disclosed in Visa's Annual 10-K figures, the company reported that payment volumes totaled $6.843 trillion with total transaction figures at 148.5 billion. When dividing the $6.843 trillion in cash volume by the number of transactions reported by Visa, we derive the average cash value of each transaction moving through the Visa Network. Therefore, $6.843T divided by 148.5 billion = $46 in average transaction.

We then take the $46 in average transaction and apply it to Apple Pay's estimated transaction volume in terms of dollars, which gives us 239.13 million transactions in FY'15, 1.434 billion transactions in FY'16 and so forth. Keep in mind Apple Pay's transaction volume directly corresponds with the Visa network, as Apple is not the merchant network provider, but is an added service layer for mobile payments.

We then use the 0.15% per transaction figure to derive our estimates on net revenue contribution. Hence, each $46 transaction translates into $0.07 for each Apple Pay transaction. We then use the payment volume estimate by RBC, divide by $46 and apply $0.07 as the transaction spread in our net revenue estimate. This gives us a fairly accurate depiction of Payment revenue contribution.

When comparing my modified figures, I derive $1.792 billion in net revenue contribution in FY'20 using the same exact transaction volume figures derived by Amit Daryanani. Furthermore, the figures Daryanani estimates is $1.76 billion, so we're within the ballpark of each other.

I run figures to include 10% operating expense, and perhaps 25% (in-line with Apple's reported corporate tax rate). Hence, my net profit margin estimate for Apple Pay alone is 52% currently, which contributes approx. $930 million in net profits by FY'20.

When valuing the business on the basis of peer/comparable multiples, I value Apple Pay at an end of five-year period valuation of $52.8 billion (using peer payment provider multiples). I then discount that forward valuation via Apple's current WACC (weighted average cost of capital) of 11.53%.

Can Apple double its service/app store revenue by 2020?

Since Apple Pay is the differentiating growth factor in our financial model, we separate the historical revenue growth CAGR from the remaining Apple Services business units, and then integrate the separate Apple Pay contribution separately.

Generally speaking, I don't necessarily believe in SOTP (sum-of-the-parts) analysis, but it's a worthwhile exercise to explore, as it helps to illustrate the value investment thesis for AAPL investors.

As such, I believe Apple's Payment business would need to scale up to $1.8 billion/year, total M&A spending would need to match $24-$25 billion, and services revenue CAGR would need to continue at its five-year average for Apple to grow this business to $50 billion+ by FY'20.

Generally speaking, I believe Apple Pay revenue contribution would give Apple just enough room to double-up on its services business at $47.77 billion, which is just shy of $48.6 billion when added into historical revenue CAGR and extrapolated out into 2020.

However, if the current business segments excl. Apple Pay were to decelerate, then it would diminish the likelihood of Apple actually doubling this business in size. Hence, I also include $24 billion in M&A related activity, assuming the acquired businesses were bought at 6x sales, which would contribute an incremental $4 billion in service revenue. The 6x sales figure is derived from software sector average valuations. Albeit, the scope of the acquisitions would vary in size, I believe my estimates more or less conforms with industry multiples, and likely scope of Apple's M&A activity upon cash repatriation.

As such, I anticipate the services business to contribute $51.77 billion in sales by FY'20, assuming a reasonable scenario of Apple Pay + M&A ramp.

However, I take on a more neutral stance, and exclude the impact of M&A, while also including Apple Pay contribution to derive my value estimate for the business unit.

I believe the Apple Services business has a net profit margin of 38.9% or so. This is driven by Apple's average corporate tax rate of approx. 25%, and operating costs that compose 10% of the segment's total revenue. Hence, I value Apple's service business after forecasting $18.6 billion in net income contribution by FY'20, and applying 25.29 earnings multiple to that figure. I then discount my estimate by AAPL's WACC of 11.53% to derive an estimated value of Apple's service/software business.

Keep in mind, this is more for illustrative purposes than actual value computation. That being the case, I believe Apple Services should be valued at $306 billion. I believe the hardware business contributes $35 billion in net income in FY'17, and when valued using my current estimate of $586 billion, the combined business units on an SOTP basis should be worth $892 billion, or $169.96 per share.

Of course, I'm not suggesting that Apple will reach $169.96 in 2017, but if we lived in a perfectly rational world, AAPL would be trading at a higher value premium.

Final thoughts

Keep in mind, the estimate I derived could prove too aggressive if in the event software categories excl. Apply Pay were to decelerate, though I believe Apple can sustain software/service revenue ramp when assuming greater software attach to hardware sales.

Furthermore, there's no indication that Apple will acquire businesses as aggressively as my estimates suggest. If anything, valuation is a bit subjective, as Apple tends to buy smaller tech franchises that have yet to report meaningful revenue/earnings contribution. Apple may supplement service revenue growth with some M&A activity, but the degree to which it may impact revenue/earnings is subjective at best.

In the most optimistic scenario, Apple acquires a cumulative $4 billion in attached revenue from M&A at a $24 billion market capitalization (assuming 6x sales). However, if Apple acquires private tech unicorns, the value premium could easily balloon past 15x sales, hence, Apple's cash repatriation may trigger an M&A race that pushes tech valuations even higher thus diminishing the actual revenue/earnings accretion.

I'm fairly optimistic on Apple's service segment, and will likely revise my financial model to reflect greater service revenue contribution in FY'17 and FY'18.

We continue to reiterate our high conviction buy recommendation, and $156 price target.

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Even Steve Jobs Would Like This  New Report: Apple's Mac Is No Longer Virus-Free Macs have long enjoyed a reputation as being virus-free compared to the constant security scares affecting Windows machines.

But the reality isn't that simple.

The number of cases of affecting Macs has surged wildly over the last year -- growing by a huge 744% in 2016, according to the new McAfee Threat Report.

(We first saw it over on 9to5Mac, and you can read the full report below.)

The security firm detected 460,000 instances of malware on Macs. (That means it found nearly half a million infections -- not half a million different types of malware.)

The reason for this huge growth is adware bundling, McAfee says.

In other words, people are installing apps that come bundled with dodgy software ("adware") that sticks ads on their computer. It's invasive, but it's not necessarily as catastrophic as other types of malware -- like ransomware, which encrypts your data and forces you to pay a ransom to get it back (though multiple kinds can come bundled together, of course).

Apple offers an App Store on desktop, much like it does on iOS. By only using apps from there or trusted sources, users can mitigate their chances of getting hit. Use common sense, don't install apps from shady sources or unknown developers, and be careful what else it asks to install during the install process.

And remember: The 744% growth sounds alarming -- but it's still nothing compared to the amount of malware for Windows that McAfee identified.

Nearly 640 million malware instances were found overall by McAfee -- with the vast majority of these coming from Windows. The Mac malware is still a drop in the ocean in comparison.

Here's the full report from McAfee:

GET TO KNOW THE DOW

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the oldest and most-often cited stock market index for the American equities market. Along with other major indices such as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, it remains one of the most visible representations of the stock market to the outside world. The index consists of 30 blue chip companies and is a price-weighted index as opposed to a market-cap weighted index. This approach has made it somewhat controversial among market watchers. (See: Opinion: The DJIA is a Relic and We Need to Move On) The history of the index dates all the way back to 1896 when it was first created by Charles Dow, the legendary founding editor of the Wall Street Journal and founder of Dow Jones & Company, and Edward Jones, a statistician. The price-weighted, scaled index has since become a standard part of most major daily news recaps and has seen dozens of different companies pass through its ranks, with only General Electric ($GE) remaining on the index since its inception.

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): iPhone 8 Will Be Less Curved Than Galaxy S8 Apple Inc. s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 8 will be less curved than the Samsung Galaxy S8, according to a note from JP Morgan analyst Rod Hall.

The analyst believes that the OLED iPhone model will not have an edge-to-edge display like the Galaxy S8, 9to5 Mac reported.

 While Apple s new OLED form factor looks similar, current indications are for less use of curved OLED which may result in a slightly less  infinity  screen form factor,  Hall said in the note to clients.

Previous reports suggested that the high-end OLED iPhone 8 would be an expensive handset. It is said to get a hefty price tag of $1,000.

According to Hall, the average selling price of the entire next iPhone line to expand as the expected iPhone 8 hits around $1000 ASP.

The analyst predicted that the high-end iPhone models will come with a 3GB RAM configuration. He also believes that NAND Flash providers and other suppliers will  benefit from the potential content increase in the upcoming iPhone. 

Hall raised his forecast for the expected  iPhone supercycle  to 260 million units in 2018 from 245 million.

 We have raised our FY18 iPhone forecast to 260mn units (vs. consensus at 225mn) from 245mn units, driven by a strong feature upgrade and robust replacement demand, with the installed base at 1.1bn units. With a ~$1,000 ASP for the OLED model, we also anticipate ASP expansion in the next iPhone cycle. 

iPhone 8

Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is rumored to launch the iPhone 8 in September alongside  iPhone 7s  and  iPhone 7s Plus  models.

The 10th-anniversery iPhone is expected to sport a 5.8-inch OLED screen. According to the rumors mill, the iPhone 8 would feature a long-distance wireless charging technology.

Moreover, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has predicted that the premium iPhone model would feature a dual-lens camera that Apple introduced in the 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus. According to a report from The Korea Economic Daily, the iPhone 8 might sport a 3D camera.

Shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) closed down 0.19% on Friday. The stock is up more than 24% year-to-date. During the last 12 months, the iPhone maker s stock have surged nearly 36%.
