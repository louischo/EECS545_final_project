Still A Value Trap?   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), EQT Corporation (EQT) Shares of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) are making a strong comeback as they have jumped 41.81% since bottoming out at $32.83 on Mar. 16, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 2.04% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 20.43% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -0.32% from $47 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 13, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 37.74% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s shares projecting a $47.35 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.71%, and the sector s average is 4.45%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -28.19% since hitting a peak level of $80.61 on Jun. 29, 2016. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -9.27% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -11.56% so far on the year   still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 2.39% higher from $56.46, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Mar. 09, 2017, but are collecting gains at -20.23% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $57.81, EQT has a chance to add $25.29 or 43.75% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($83.1) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.88 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, EQT Corporation s EPS growth has been nearly -24.3%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 23.6%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. EQT Corporation s ROE is -8.28%, while industry s is -9.13%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 9.34%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. EQT s ROA is -0.89%, while industry s average is -2.92%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 2.75.

Drybulk Carrier Segment Summary Operating Data (unaudited)

(Dollars in thousands, except average daily results)

Drybulk Three Months Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2015 2016 2015 2016 Average number of vessels(1) 26.5 15.2 35.8 19.4 Total voyage days for vessels(2) 2,341 1,221 12,562 6,404 Total calendar days for vessels(3) 2,434 1,394 13,060 7,116 Fleet utilization(4) 96.2% 87.6% 96.2% 90.0% Time charter equivalent(5) $5,097 $5,444 $9,171 $3,658 Vessel operating expenses (daily)(6) $6,528 $4,772 $6,715 $4,826

(1) Average number of vessels is the number of vessels that constituted our fleet for the relevant period, as measured by the sum of the number of days each vessel was a part of our fleet during the period divided by the number of calendar days in that period.

(2) Total voyage days for fleet are the total days the vessels were in our possession for the relevant period net of dry-docking and laid-up days.

(3) Calendar days are the total number of days the vessels were in our possession for the relevant period including dry-docking days and laid-up days.

(4) Fleet utilization is the percentage of time that our vessels were available for revenue generating voyage days, and is determined by dividing voyage days by fleet calendar days for the relevant period.

(5) Time charter equivalent, or TCE, is a measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel on a per voyage basis. Our method of calculating TCE is consistent with industry standards and is determined by dividing voyage revenues (net of voyage expenses) by voyage days for the relevant time period. Voyage expenses primarily consist of port, canal and fuel costs that are unique to a particular voyage and are paid by the charterer under a time charter contract, as well as commissions. TCE revenues, a non-U.S. GAAP measure, provides additional meaningful information in conjunction with revenues from our vessels, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, because it assists our management in making decisions regarding the deployment and use of its vessels and in evaluating their financial performance. TCE is also a standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e., spot charters, time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Please see below for a reconciliation of TCE rates to voyage revenues.

(6) Daily vessel operating expenses, which includes crew costs, provisions, deck and engine stores, lubricating oil, insurance, maintenance and repairs is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by fleet calendar days net of laid-up days for the relevant time period.

(7) Does not include accrual for the provision of the purchase options and write off in overdue receivables under certain time charter agreements.

(In thousands of U.S. dollars, except for TCE rate, which is expressed in Dollars, and voyage days)

New executive team will oversee Yahoo Marissa Mayer will no longer be the CEO of Yahoo Inc. when the company is acquired by Verizon (Photo: AP file photo)

Yahoo Inc. has named the top executives who will lead what s left of the company after its digital services are sold to Verizon.

Yahoo said in a regulatory filing on Monday that Thomas McInerney will be CEO of the leftover company, to be called Altaba Inc. McInerney has been on Yahoo s board since April 2012 and has worked at IAC/InterActiveCorp and Ticketmaster.

Arthur Chong will serve as general counsel and secretary and Alexi Wellman as chief financial and accounting officer. DeAnn Fairfield Work was named chief compliance officer.

CEO Marissa Mayer, a Wausau native, will stay at Yahoo until the $4.48 billion Verizon deal closes. That s expected by the end of June. The filing did not say what will happen to her position after the changes.

Verizon had agreed to buy Yahoo s online business following a long slump at the internet company, but the deal was later jeopardized after Yahoo disclosed major computer hacking attacks that compromised the personal information of more than 1 billion users. The breaches were the two biggest in internet history.

RELATED: Verizon shaves $350 million from Yahoo price

RELATED: Mayer's legacy is diminishing at Yahoo

Yahoo recently said it won t be paying Mayer s annual bonus or give her a potentially lucrative stock award because an investigation concluded her management team reacted too slowly to one breach discovered in 2014.

Monday s filing revealed that Mayer will receive a $23 million severance package if she doesn t work for Verizon.

Verizon demanded a $925 million discount on its acquisition of Yahoo s online services to help offset the damage from the data breaches. It ultimately settled on a $350 million concession.

Yahoo disclosed new details about its negotiations with Verizon in a regulatory filing Monday. The filing doesn t say why Verizon accepted the lower figure, which was previously announced.

The companies struck a $4.83 billion deal last July but re-opened talks after Yahoo revealed that personal information had been stolen from more than 1 billion of its users in two separate hacking attacks during 2013 and 2014.

(YHOO) Tell An Interesting Tale The technicals for Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have taken shape, and with them a comprehensive picture has emerged. This is the current state of play as presented by the current technical setup. The technical data for a stock offers a rich environment for establishing trading and investing decisions. By taking a keen examination of technical indicators, chart patterns and historical data, traders and investors can make crucial decisions.

(YHOO) has shown a marked change in trend levels over the course of recent market activity. Based on recent activity surrounding both the 50 and 200 SMAs, there s been a marked trend created which can be described as bullish. The composite picture painted by the trends built around both SMAs has also created a measured analysis of current investor sentiment as the stock navigates upside and downside risk. The established market sentiment toward the stock has created a trading environment which can suitably be described as positive. There has also been a knock-on effect as it relates to trading volume now reflected in weak real-time sentiment on the buying and selling curve; this has created in turn, indifference toward the stock as measured across a broad statistical mix of the general trading community.

As a composite and comprehensive tableau, the stock s position in the minds of the trading market reflects a broad analysis of technicals and inherent trends which underpin overall market-trading viability.

Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures are two very important leading indicators that help traders gauge overall movement of a particular stock; they act as boosters to technical analysis. Together they show in a measured way, whether or not a stock currently overbought or oversold. This indicator is crucial in determining whether traders are tipped toward the side of buying more of the stock, or doing the opposite and selling more of the stock. This is very important directional information necessary for making trading decisions. (YHOO) s current measure for its 14-day RSI is 62.32%; this is suggestive that on balance of the indicator, the stock is neutral   neither overbought nor oversold and therefore not susceptible to any undue price movements in either direction. The stochastic picture presents a complimentary view of overall sentiment in the present state for (YHOO). Stochastic data gathered over the last 30 days has created a score of 65.28%. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought or oversold at current levels.

Often the indicators laid out above do not communicate fully all that a trader needs to know. In these instances, reliance can be placed upon chart indicators that provide a view of short-term movement and/or long term performance. The omens depict a telling picture in terms of the near-term trading setup for (YHOO); this makes things very interesting to the curious and interested eye. The +0.90 has created a positive in the trailing 30 days since initiating movement. Over the extended term, the stock has outperform the S&P 500 by 23.01%. This consistent movement and its attendant overall performance have produced higher daily volatility when compared with other stocks ranking in the same peer group and on the same exchange. The picture looks the same when the stock is assessed against volatility levels measured historically. This historical volatility gives a current reading of 11.85%. These measures of historic volatility are very handy in judging the underlying price momentum and the rate of change in the price of (YHOO). Bound up this picture of volatility, is another measure that gives the underlying thesis for (YHOO). This can best be seen by analyzing the readings for the stock s average true range, currently 1.38. ATR is a fine augment to the other indicators outlined above and should be used in conjunction and not as a standalone. Hot Stocks: Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), EOG Resources, Inc. (EOG) Yahoo! Inc.

Inc. (YHOO) Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Internet Information Providers. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $46.60, up from yesterday s close by 1.17%. Given the stock s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company s recent data.

Fundamental Analysis

Does this stock stack up well when compared to its peers in the industry space? Let s take a look. Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) currently trades with a market capitalization of $44.57 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 15.37 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company s last quarterly report.

The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For YHOO, the company currently has $1.17 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.01 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.08 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 1.76% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

Technical Analysis

Sometimes, we can understand most about a stock by simply looking at how it has been trading. Looking at the stock s movement on the chart, Yahoo! Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $47.19. It is now trading 0.59% off that level. The stock is trading $44.87 its 50-day moving average by -1.73%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $33.93.

In recent action, Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has made a move of +2.62% over the past month, which has come on weak relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 18.62, and it s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 6.00% with $883.52 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of YHOO. Time To Get Cautious?   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), Five Below, Inc. (FIVE) Shares of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) are on a recovery track as they have regained 37.34% since bottoming out at $34.62 on Mar. 24, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.02% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 20.51% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -1.25% from $47.19 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 21, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 33.91% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s shares projecting a $47.63 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.83%, and the sector s average is 4.84%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -19.83% since hitting a peak level of $52.7 on Jul. 27, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 6.18% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 5.73% so far on the year   still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 20.61% higher from $35.03, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Nov. 04, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 2.5% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $42.25, FIVE has a chance to add $6.48 or 15.34% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($48.73) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 0.97 , so you might not be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Five Below, Inc. s EPS growth has been nearly 135.1%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 22.03%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Five Below, Inc. s ROE is 26.82%, while industry s is 15.1%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 12.63%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. FIVE s ROA is 14.65%, while industry s average is 7.52%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 6.39.

2017-01-05
Here's What You Might Not Know About Yahoo Have you noticed that Yahoo has managed to make a lot of headlines during the past year but none of them on the desirable side? It's as if every time the company attempts to reorganize its game plan and unveil new offerings to its consumer base, something happens to foul it up. Enormous data breaches, highly scrutinized leadership, and a possible acquisition by a telecommunications company (do telecom and Web marriages ever work out?) are just some of the events Yahoo has endured lately. Everyone is watching.

But we think good news is (finally!) on the way. The undervaluation of Yahoo's Asian cross holdings should not last much longer because the deal to sell Verizon (NYSE:VZ) the American Yahoo core should close in 1Q17 and the new Republican administration is widely expected to cut the corporate tax rate to 15%. In 2Q17, Yahoo appears likely to sell its Yahoo Japan shares, merge away or liquidate its Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) stock and distribute remaining cash. Today Verizon signaled to the debt markets that it sought $5.5bn to finance the long-awaited purchase of Yahoo's core business.

Today's approximate $38.50 closing price represents a 30% discount to the $54.83 sum of the parts, or a $16.33/share spread. If we taxed/discounted the entire structure at 15%, we get $54.83 * (1-15%) = $46.61, or a 20% upside from $38.50.

Yahoo has its core business ($5.07/shr), a pile of Alibaba stock ($34.89/shr), a heap of Yahoo Japan (OTCPK:YAHOY) ($8.07/shr) and a giant stack of net cash ($6.80/shr): $5.07 Core + $34.89 BABA + $8.07 4689 JP + $6.80 Cash = $54.83 total. Verizon will pay about $730mm in cash to close out Yahoo's 21mm share equity incentive plans, so the per share estimates above benefit modestly.

The downside? If we put both the Alibaba and Yahoo Japan stakes on 40% discounts, respectively, cash on a 10% discount and fix Yahoo core at the take-out price, the downside is about $37.00 or -4% from $38.50. Another way to think about the downside in Yahoo is to reflect on the downside in BABA. We don't have a view on the BABA downside because we hedge it out. That said, for the fiscal year ended March 2017E, BABA is expected by the Street to earn $3.16/share (+81% y/y) on $21.7bn of sales (+14% y/y).

Long 1 Yahoo share and short 0.4 shares of BABA (the so-called 'Yahoo stub trade') has had fits and starts; see below. This chart does not hedge out Yahoo Japan. Key drivers have been IRS announcements and company comments. Many investors have owned the stub on swap, a higher return, capital-efficient (albeit more volatile) approach that appears poised to finally work.

Some have argued that the Yahoo remains will be acquired in an all-stock deal by the Alibaba mothership. Reasonable people may differ as to the likelihood of a deal but we can all agree that given the choice, Alibaba would prefer not to have a $30bn liquid alternative to its own stock floating around forever, particularly when that alternative persistently trades at some discount and represents 15% of their own company.

If the tax rate stays at 40%, bears may argue that Alibaba will bide its time, talk down the chance of a deal and then make a lowball offer. If the tax rate changes to 15%, bulls would argue that BABA will wait until Verizon has cleared away the American Yahoo core and then take a clean shot at an all-stock offer at some small discount to parity. The board's task is to move the conversation away from tax discount and toward merger premium by creating a competitive bidding process. The fairness standards of the Delaware courts support the bull case.

Verizon expects to close the purchase of the Yahoo US core operation during 1Q17, and last week received approval from European regulators. Also in the news this month, Yahoo disclosed a billion-user data breach that was thought to have taken place in 2013. The breach news represents the second such case following the announcement of the transaction. The New York Times DealProfessor seems to think no one cares about the data breach (or for that matter any of the other recent data breaches by other companies).

In response, Verizon may seek a price cut. But based on conversations with Verizon, they still like the asset, and although they may or may not get it cheaper, they are still doing the deal. Let Yahoo cut the price by a billion dollars, or let them not cut the price by a billion dollars. Yahoo has roughly a billion Yahoo shares outstanding. Cut the price of the Yahoo core and one cuts the proceeds paid to Yahoo by about a buck a share. Yahoo closed at $38.50 yesterday, so a $1 change in price is a 2.6% change in value.

With limited downside, a hard catalyst, and favorable tax and fiscal policy, at long last, the Yahoo trade appears ripe (whether stub trade or outright long).

I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article. Verizon exec voices doubts over Yahoo deal Weeks after Yahoo Inc. disclosed a massive data breach, Verizon Communications Inc. is unsure whether it will proceed with its $4.83 billion purchase of the internet company s core business, a top Verizon executive said Thursday.

Marni Walden, a Verizon VZ, -0.25% executive vice president, said the carrier is still studying the impact of a data breach at Yahoo YHOO, +1.66% that affected more than 1 billion accounts, which the internet firm disclosed in December. The hack occurred in 2013 and is separate from a 2014 breach that exposed 500 million Yahoo accounts.

When asked at an investor conference in Las Vegas whether the telecom giant would proceed with the deal, Walden said:  Unfortunately, I can t sit here today and say with confidence one way or the other because we still don t know. 

A Yahoo spokeswoman said:  We are confident in Yahoo s value and we continue to work towards integration with Verizon.

The world's first 3-screen gaming laptop is mind-blowing Have you ever wondered what a 17-inch laptop would look like if someone strapped two extra screens to its sides? Well, that s both an oddly specific thought, and exactly what the insane folks at PC gaming company Razer have dreamt up with their new Project Valerie concept laptop.

Debuting at CES 2017, this behemoth of a gaming rig features a brilliant 17-inch, 4K-resolution display with 100% Adobe RGB color accuracy that ensures everything from movies to the latest games look absolutely gorgeous.

Flip the onboard switch, though, and out slide two additional 17-inch, 4K-resolution panels. Aggressively unnecessary? You bet. Ridiculously cool? You know it!

View photos Unfortunately, you can t buy the Project Valerie, as it s just a concept   for now. More

The idea behind Project Valerie is to give gamers the ability to use multiple monitors without having to deal with a rat s nest of wires on their desks. Of course, the feature comes in handy at work, too. With three screens you can multitask with a number of programs at once without having to search through a million tabs and minimized apps.

Razer s over-the-top laptop also virtually guarantees that you ll be the most hated person at your local Starbucks when you deploy its massive screens.

That much added mass also means that the Project Valerie will weigh just a bit more than your MacBook Air. According to Razer, the system is expected to weigh less than 12 pounds, which isn t exactly lightweight.

Naturally, Project Valerie will be an absolute performance monster. Razer says it will equip the laptop with Nvidia s (NVDA) latest GeForce GTX 1080 graphics chip, which means the system will be able to handle VR headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.

Like every Razer laptop, Project Valerie s keyboard will include the company s Chroma lighting system, so you can show off your gaming bona fides whether you re pounding out TPS reports or pounding n00bs in  Overwatch. 

Since Project Valerie is still just a concept device, there s no guarantee it will ever hit the market. Even if it does, it will likely cost a good chunk of change thanks to its high-end displays. Still, I m holding out hope that I ll one day own a ridiculous three-screen laptop just like I ve always dreamed.

Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock Really Worth $150? Goldman Sachs (ticker: GS) gave Apple Inc. ( AAPL) shareholders an early Valentine's Day present on Monday, raising its price target to from $133 to $150 per share. Naturally, AAPL stock responded well to the news; shares rose about 1 percent in response to the praise, hitting 52-week highs in the process.

The $150 level represents a 13.5 percent increase from Friday's closing price of $132.12.

The question is: How realistic is Goldman's $150 price target?

[Read: The 10 Most Anticipated IPOs of 2017.]

Don't count Apple out. Apple is coming off a blowout quarter, one that beat nearly all analyst expectations and sent AAPL stock skyrocketing. Shares jumped 6 percent following the fiscal first-quarter results.

A big part of what made Apple's first quarter numbers so good were the shockingly good iPhone sales numbers, which analysts expected to be very muted following a string of disappointing results in the quarters preceding it.

Point being: just when you count AAPL out, the company shows it still has a trick or two up its sleeve. And if Goldman's right, Apple's greatest tricks are yet to come.

Goldman's thesis. The bottom line is that Goldman expects big things from the iPhone, the 2007 invention that quickly became Apple's best-selling product, transformed the business, and turned it into the most valuable company in the world.

Last quarter alone, AAPL sold over $54 billion worth of iPhones, setting a company record and accounting for nearly 70 percent of Apple's overall sales.

But Goldman expects the iPhone 8 to be a major improvement from the iPhone 7, seeing as this will be the 10-year anniversary of the first model.

Apple has been roundly criticized for not making meaningful changes from one iPhone model to the next, but this time, the tech community will be expecting something big.

"The iPhone7 didn't offer the upgrade that many consumers were looking for, but the next model is rumored to be packed with several new features. I am not sure about $150 as Goldman Sachs suggests, but extending to $143, Bloomberg's 12-month consensus target price might not quite as far fetched," says Chris Kim, senior vice president and chief investment officer at Tompkins Financial Advisors, based in White Plains, New York.

Goldman specifically expects the iPhone 8 to come with a "3D sensing functionality" that would "enable a robust augmented reality feature set that we believe will be a key differentiator." Apple insiders have hinted before at AR and virtual reality would be major points of focus for AAPL going forward, and following the huge success of games like Pokemon Go in 2016, any iOS or phone manufacturer that makes AR easy to develop for and play with has the potential to be richly rewarded.

Not only that, but Goldman thinks the iPhone 8 will have an OLED display, allowing for the removal of the home button entirely. Some have suggested the iPhone 8 will be the first iPhone with the ability to charge wirelessly as well, would be a huge step forward.

"The phone is speculated to have some nice features that are more function than form, which tends to draw in more upgraders than normal," says Peter Karazeris, an analyst with Thrivent Financial in Minnesota.

Last and perhaps most importantly, Goldman expects the iPhone 8 to have three SKUs: the current 4.7" model, the current 5.5" model, and the yet-to-be-released 5.8" model.

The reason this additional 5.8" model would be so great for AAPL, as you might have guessed, is because it'd be more expensive than the other two, raising the average selling price for all iPhones sold and boosting the top line.

Currently the 4.7" model goes for $649 and the 5.5" model goes for $769, so seeing an average selling price at or near $800 a pop for the largest model seems quite reasonable.

But Goldman needs more than just chatter about the long-anticipated 10th iPhone anniversary to justify its $150 price target for AAPL stock.

The Wall Street bank does that by raising its projected iPhone sales for 2017 from 227.3 million phones to 230 million. For 2018, it increased its forecast from 231.5 million phones to 235.9 million.

[Read: 5 Reasons Donald Trump's Presidency Will Include a Recession.]

More importantly, Goldman is raising the earnings multiple it believes AAPL stock deserves from 14 to 16, making each dollar of earnings worth 14.3 percent more than it used to. Earnings multiples usually rise when greater growth is expected from a company in the coming years than there was previously, so a slight boost in Apple's multiple makes sense.

Yahoo! Inc. Slides Verizon Deal Back to Q2 Online information portal Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) reported results for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 after the closing bell on Monday. Citing the pending buyout offer from Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), management declined to hold a conference call with analysts.

Yahoo!'s fourth-quarter results: The raw numbers

Metric Q4 2016 Q4 2015 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $1.47 billion $1.27 billion 16% Net income $64 million $64 million N/A GAAP EPS (diluted) $0.17 ($4.70) N/A

What happened with Yahoo! this quarter?

Mobile traffic and video services continued to take a more prominent role in Yahoo!'s product portfolio in the fourth quarter.

Bottom-line earnings were held back by a $4.45 billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the year-ago quarter. There were no such accounting adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2016. Backing out that enormous non-cash line item and other one-time charges, adjusted fourth-quarter earnings nearly doubled from $0.13 to $0.25 per diluted share.

Mobile revenues rose 58% year over year, landing at $459 million. Desktop traffic produced 2.6% revenue growth, stopping at $955 million.

Breaking the revenue stream down from a different perspective, operations under the Mavens banner delivered 25% sales growth while non-Mavens services settled at 10% growth. As a reminder, Mavens refers to operations in Yahoo!'s mobile, video, and native ads divisions, plus the impact from recently acquired businesses.

The number of paid search clicks decreased by 21% compared with the year-ago quarter. At the same time, price per click increased by 18%.

The Verizon transaction is still a work in progress. Yahoo! now expects to close the deal in the second quarter of 2017, as the work required to meet closing conditions is taking more time than expected.

The company did not supply any financial guidance for the coming quarter or fiscal year.

What management had to say

Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer underscored the company's commitment to the existing strategic plan, even as management worked to close the Verizon deal.

"With our 2016 and Q4 financial results ahead of plan, and the continued stability in our user engagement trends, the opportunities ahead with Verizon look bright," Mayer said in a prepared statement.

Looking ahead

As a standalone business, Yahoo!'s Maven focus is paying off. These operations are growing sales quickly, and profits are following suit. Adjusted EBITDA profits rose 51% in the fourth quarter to $324 million, and free cash flows jumped from roughly breakeven to a healthy $231 million.

Verizon has been showing signs of cold feet about its pending Yahoo! buyout. At the very least, this solid report did nothing to undermine Verizon's confidence and may have helped pushing the deal along. Citi Spoofing and Yahoo Hacking Spoofing!

It seems like pretty big news that Citigroup Global Markets Inc. agreed to pay a $25 million penalty to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission last week to settle charges that it spoofed the U.S. Treasury futures market. Like ... Citi is a big bank, and Treasury futures are a big market, and $25 million is a big fine. It's the biggest spoofing story since that time a random dude in London maybe crashed the stock market.

But the CFTC and Citi don't seem to be very interested in telling the story. The CFTC order is brief, bland and generic. Five Citigroup traders "engaged in the disruptive practice of 'spoofing' (bidding or offering with the intent to cancel the bid or offer before execution) in U.S. Treasury futures markets" in 2011 and 2012, and they did it more than 2,500 times. (Bloomberg News has their names.) The "spoofing strategy involved placing bids or offers of 1,000 lots or more" -- $100 million or more face amount -- "with the intent to cancel those orders before execution"; they put in the spoofing orders "after another smaller bid or offer was placed on the opposite side of the same or a correlated futures or cash market," and cancelled them "after either the smaller resting orders had been filled or the Traders believed that the spoofing orders were at too great a risk of being executed."

That is how one spoofs, yes. But there are no funny e-mails or chats, no details of the trades or profits, no sense of how or why this happened, except that it happened a lot. Well, there is one anecdote, about a junior trader in Tokyo who visited the New York desk for training. He was apparently trained in spoofing, but not very well:

In January 2012, the junior trader returned to Tokyo and began placing spoofing orders. In one instance, on January 31, 2012, he placed a 4,000 lot offer in the 10-year U.S. Treasury futures market that he intended to cancel before execution to induce other market participants to trade on his smaller resting bid in the 10-year cash U.S. Treasury market. The majority of his 4,000 lot spoofing order traded before he could cancel the order and, as a result, he incurred a loss. Afterwards, the junior trader called several other members of the U.S. Treasury desk, including the head of the desk, to report his loss and explain his spoofing strategy and what had happened. Although the supervisor told the junior trader "that's not a smart thing to do" and cautioned him not to do it again, neither the supervisor nor the other members of the U.S. Treasury desk reported the incident to compliance or any other senior manager, despite having information that the junior trader engaged in spoofing.

Did the supervisor mean that spoofing is "not a smart thing to do," or just getting executed on your spoof order? Because the latter is inarguable.

The former is a little inarguable too? People talk about "white-collar crime" (fraud, etc.) as distinct from "blue-collar crime" (burglary, etc.), but there is a social hierarchy of fraud, too. Big banks might collude on a benchmark fixing, or sell mortgage bonds with misrepresentations about the level of due diligence they conducted, but they don't, like, run Ponzi schemes. Individual junior bankers might insider trade here and there, but big banks' trading desks don't make their money by insider trading. This is not because banks are paragons of morality; it's because they are big institutions with big compliance departments who have read the rules and thought about ways to prevent well-known sorts of dumb obvious misbehavior. Perhaps this leads to a culture of compliance, or perhaps it leads to a culture of baroque sneaky misbehavior, but in any case it probably does catch the low-hanging fruit.

These days spoofing feels pretty blue-collar, and most spoofing enforcement cases so far have tended to be against small firms and independent traders. And Citi's spoofing -- putting in 1,000-contract orders, trading small orders on the other side, and canceling the 1,000-contract orders, over and over again, thousands of times -- just feels too big and dumb and obvious for a big bank. But here we are. I suppose things were different in 2011 and 2012, when regulators were just beginning to take spoofing seriously. Sometimes it takes time for misbehavior to become dumb and obvious.

Yahoo!?

Here is a story about how the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating Yahoo Inc. because it was hacked in 2014 and waited two years to disclose the hack to shareholders. (And users! It waited two years to disclose to users that they had been hacked! But that's not the SEC's concern.) On the one hand, sure, absolutely: You should disclose material stuff, and if you don't, then investors are misled into buying your stock at inflated prices, and then they are harmed when the stuff is disclosed and the price drops.

The weird thing about Yahoo, though, is that it waited so long to disclose the hack that, by the time it did, it had already agreed to sell itself to Verizon Communications Inc. (Well, to sell the Yahoo bits of itself. It's keeping some other bits, and renaming the stub "Altaba.") And Verizon hadn't known about the hack either. Now it does, of course, though it is still unclear whether it will try to re-negotiate the deal because of the hacks.

But this makes the SEC's potential case weird, especially if the deal closes as scheduled for the agreed price. Like: If Yahoo agreed to sell its business for a fixed amount of cash before disclosing the hack, and then it sells it for that amount of cash after disclosing the hack, then was the hack material? Shareholders got the same amount of money from Verizon after the disclosure as they expected to before the disclosure. And if the SEC ends up fining Yahoo for not disclosing it, who pays the fine? Verizon is getting the guilty businesses, but it seems a bit rough to make Verizon pay more for a hacked Yahoo than it had originally agreed to pay for an un-hacked Yahoo. Presumably Altaba would pay, which would mean that Yahoo's disclosure breach deceived shareholders but didn't cost them any money -- but that the SEC's efforts to protect those shareholders would cost them money.

Active ETFs.

One problem with mutual funds is that if you buy a mutual fund, and don't sell it, you still have to pay capital gains taxes on it. This is not true of most other investments: If you buy stock, and it goes up, you don't pay taxes on the appreciation until you sell. Certainly if the stock doesn't go up, and you don't sell, you don't pay taxes. But "a mutual fund manager must constantly re-balance the fund by selling securities to accommodate shareholder redemptions," which "creates capital gains for the shareholders, even for shareholders who may have an unrealized loss on the overall mutual fund investment."

A big advantage of exchange-traded funds is that they don't do that: When you want out of your ETF, you sell your shares to another investor, or get redeemed in kind, so the ETF is not constantly selling securities (and incurring taxes) to meet redemptions.

The ETF approach feels right, and the mutual-fund approach feels dumb, which is why people who manage mutual funds are constantly trying to turn them into ETFs. If you run an index fund where everyone always knows what's in it, this is pretty easy. If you run an actively managed fund, it's hard. The point of an ETF is that it is exchange-traded: People know what securities the ETF holds, they know what those securities are worth, and they can make sure the ETF's price is right by arbitraging between the ETF and the underlying securities. An active fund whose holdings are secret, or semi-secret -- active funds disclose their holdings periodically, but not minute-by-minute -- can't be effectively arbitraged.

But of course the active managers don't care about that. They just want the tax advantages of ETFs, and will take convoluted approaches to get them. So here is a story about how J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. "is joining a long line of asset managers" hoping to license Precidian Investment's "ActiveShares" nontransparent ETF model, which "would disclose stockholdings on a delay rather than daily," if the SEC approves it.

I am a little torn. On the one hand, the ETF model -- of ensuring price accuracy by arbitrage -- is an elegant one, and the nontransparent ETF model -- of ensuring price accuracy by, um, "Precidian would post the real-time value of its holdings on exchanges" -- feels kludgy and disappointing. On the other hand, the taxation of regular mutual funds really is pretty dumb. What the active managers really want is just an incantation that allows them to run a regular mutual fund, but to be taxed like an ETF. I am sympathetic. In an ideal world, that incantation would just be checking a box that says "I'd like to be taxed like an ETF," rather than having to do weird stuff to look kind of like an ETF.

By the way, the reason people want active ETFs to be nontransparent is to avoid "giving away their proprietary trading strategies to potential copycats," and I always wonder a little if that concern is overblown. Is the worry that someone will "front-run," as it were ("back-run"?) a big fund by seeing what positions it is buying into (over several days) and racing to buy ahead of it? Or is it that, if you have a day-by-day breakdown of how a big famous expensive fund invests, you could build your own generic copycat fund and market it to investors cheaper? "The Schmimco Schmotal Schmeturn Fund follows the same strategy as the leading brand, but at half the management fee!" That would be a fun business, until it's eaten by robots.

Snap votes.

We talked last week about Snap Inc.'s proposed initial public offering, which would give public shareholders non-voting stock and no control over how the company is run. I said that journalists and academics and governance experts love to talk about how bad dual-class share structures are, but then big investors buy into dual-class IPOs anyway, and with no evident price discount. Founders are never really forced to choose between maintaining control and maximizing their economics. So of course they keep doing dual-class IPOs.

But then this article came out about how "T. Rowe Price is pushing back on Snap's plans to only sell non-voting shares in its IPO," and I thought, well, that doesn't mean much. Just because T. Rowe says it is "quietly and persistently" objecting to the dual-class IPO doesn't mean that it will actually pay less for new Snap shares. (T. Rowe is already an investor in Snap via an earlier private investment round.) But it's actually even less meaningful than that: T. Rowe actually went and issued a press release saying that "contrary to certain news reports, T. Rowe Price is not contesting the plan by Snap Inc. to issue non-voting shares in its impending initial public offering." They "generally do not favor proposals that would create disproportionate voting rights," but, you know, for Snap, sure.

If you generally don't like dual-class stock, but you can live with each specific instance of dual-class stock, you will get a lot of dual-class stock. The right way to oppose dual-class stock is to oppose it even in companies you like. But no one is willing to go quite that far.

Elsewhere, "Snapchat Is Justifying Its $20 Billion Valuation by Emphasizing User Engagement." And Snapchat seems to be cracking down on clickbait?

On Snapchat last week, MTV published an article with the headline  Is this the thirstiest person on earth?  The article, which ran on Snapchat s news service, Discover, appeared with a picture of a bikini-clad blond woman taking a selfie, even though the piece was about a fully clothed man. Those kinds of risqu  and misleading images will now be much less prominent on Discover because early on Monday, Snapchat updated its guidelines for publishers in a way that essentially cleans up what is shown on its news service.

That is the state of the media industry in 2017: A messaging service designed to allow college students to share nudes is now exercising its editorial judgment to tell major media companies to maybe cut it out with the misleading bikini pictures.

Reinsurance.

Here's a story about insurance. Basically you buy an insurance policy from Insurer X, and then you submit claims, and Insurer X pays the claims. Or it doesn't -- "all insurers have reasons to minimise claims costs" -- but if it turns you down, you have leverage. Not only can you sue to hold Insurer X to the contract, but you also have a business relationship: If Insurer X wants to sell you another policy, it had better pay your claims on this one. But Insurer X can extract some value by ceding your policy to Reinsurer Y, which has never met you, will never sell you insurance directly, and can feel free to stonewall your claims as far as it's allowed by law. The particular value extraction here comes from not being nice: By transforming the insurer/insured relationship from a customer-service relationship to a pure standoffish contractual relationship, the insurer can make it a bit more profitable.

The fun part of this story is that Insurer X is American International Group, and Reinsurer Y is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and it is funny to think that AIG is too nice and so is calling in Warren Buffett so he can be mean.

Oh, you know, the stuff.

Davos is all-in on Secret Trump Theory:

Executives gathered in the Swiss resort for the World Economic Forum this week keep repeating, like a soothing mantra, that Donald Trump is at heart a pragmatist who will avoid trade wars and regulations that make it harder to do business.  What somebody s saying is not necessarily what they re going to do,  said David Cote, chief executive officer of Honeywell International Inc.

Hey great super. Elsewhere, here's a doomed lawsuit over Trump's likely Emoluments Clause violations. Here's some advice for federal employees. And: "Habitual presidential stock tweeting should increase the component of total portfolio risk associated with individual stock risk." And: "Trump Aide Says Press Secretary Used  Alternative Facts. " And: "China Slams Western Democracy as Flawed." And: "All populists are at heart conspiracy theorists, who pretend that easy solutions exist to society s woes and have only not been tried to date because elites are wicked and deaf to the sturdy common-sense of decent, ordinary folk." And: Trump "gets bored and likes to watch TV." And: Trump apparently plagiarized Obama's inaugural cake.

People are worried about stock buybacks.

One weird thing about stock-buyback worrying is its asymmetry. If you are worried that companies are buying back too many shares, then you should be equally worried that they aren't issuing enough shares. There's nothing magical about the number of shares a company has now. If it's bad for a company to spend $100 million on buybacks instead of on building new factories, why stop there? Why shouldn't the company sell $100 million of stock, and then spend $200 million on factories? Or $300 million? Why is the right amount to spend on factories always the amount of money that the company has now? Facebook recently announced a $6 billion stock buyback, but imagine if Facebook had instead announced a $6 billion stock offering. That would have been much weirder, right?

Here is Bloomberg Gadfly's Lisa Abramowicz on debt-financed buybacks:

This is basically taking money from debt buyers to pad the pockets of equity holders. It has no obvious benefit to the company's long-term prospects; in fact, quite the opposite. As Fitch Ratings said in a report on Thursday, "leveraged share buybacks and other shareholder friendly actions are an ongoing risk to bondholders as borrowing costs remain historically low."

But is the concern here that companies have too much debt and too little equity, or is it just that they have more debt and less equity than they did before the buybacks? If you are a company with $200 of stock and $100 of debt, and you issue $50 of new debt to buy back $50 of stock, then you will have more debt and less stock. But how did we know that $200 of stock and $100 of debt were the right amounts of each? What if that was too conservative, and you were just adjusting your capital structure to get it back to a more normal ratio?

That is to some extent an unanswerable aesthetic question; more realistically, it is a question that can only be answered through the economic cycle. (You'll know, eventually, if you had too much debt!) But it is not particularly obvious that big U.S. public companies have too much debt and too little equity, in historical context:

Source: Bloomberg

I suppose that chart cheats by including financials, but still. Today, S&P 500 companies have debt equal to about 112 percent of their equity. Ten years ago, that number was 213 percent. If you didn't think then that they should issue stock equal to half of their market capitalizations to pay down debt, why would you think now that they shouldn't issue debt to buy back stock?

Me Friday.

I wrote about Wall Street research and "corporate access." It's worth pointing out that the U.K. has gotten rid of this issue: The Financial Conduct Authority banned the use of research payments for corporate access back in 2014. It still seems to be a major driver of research payments in the U.S. though.

US blocks health insurer Aetna's $34 billion Humana acquisition By Diane Bartz

(Reuters) - A U.S. judge blocked on Monday health insurer Aetna Inc's proposed $34 billion acquisition of smaller peer Humana Inc, raising the stakes for rival Anthem Inc as it battles to close a $54 billion deal to buy Cigna Corp.

The ruling is another victory for the U.S. Justice Department, whose antitrust enforcement became much more aggressive during former U.S. President Barack Obama's eight years in office, which ended last week.

Obama's successor, Donald Trump, and a Republican-controlled legislature are seeking to undo much of the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. The law reshaped the U.S. healthcare industry by mandating health insurance and creating online exchanges where consumers can shop for individual policies and get subsidies.

Aetna, Humana, Anthem and Cigna had cited Obamacare as one of the main reasons their industry needed to consolidate to cope with the costs of expanding coverage. Their shares ended trading on Monday at levels that suggested that investors continued to see little chance that the two mergers would happen.

The U.S. Justice Department filed a lawsuit last July to block Aetna's acquisition of Humana and Anthem's acquisition of Cigna, arguing that the two deals would lead to higher prices.

Anthem and Cigna are still waiting for a judge to rule on whether their merger can proceed. Investors have long been skeptical that this deal can be approved, and Leerink Research analyst Ana Gupte reiterated on Monday that she expected to also see this deal blocked.

In his ruling, Judge John Bates of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said the proposed deal would "substantially lessen competition" in the sale of Medicare Advantage plans in 364 counties in 21 states that the Justice Department had identified in its complaint, and on the Obamacare exchange in three Florida counties.

"We're reviewing the opinion now and giving serious consideration to an appeal after putting forward a compelling case," Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said. Humana did not respond to a request for comment.

Humana stands to receive a $1 billion breakup fee from Aetna should the deal be abandoned.

Jeffrey Jacobovitz, a litigator at law firm Arnall Golden Gregory LLP, said that appeals at the D.C. Circuit succeed about one-third of the time and can take a year to resolve. He added that it would be difficult, though not impossible, for Aetna to wait for Trump's new antitrust enforcers to be named and then strike a settlement to save the merger, perhaps by offering to divest more assets.

Bates dismissed Aetna's argument that there was plenty of choice for consumers because Medicare Advantage, which is managed by insurance companies, competes with traditional Medicare for the elderly and disabled, which is managed by the government.

"In that (Medicare Advantage) market, which is the primary focus of this case, the merger is presumptively unlawful - a conclusion that is strongly supported by direct evidence of head-to-head competition as well. The companies  rebuttal arguments are not persuasive," Bates wrote in a 158-page decision.

Humana shares ended trading up 2.2 percent at $205.02, as investors brushed off the widely expected ruling. Shares of Cigna, the other health insurer to be acquired, were almost flat at $145.31





SEVERAL DEALS TORPEDOED

Several big deals were torpedoed by antitrust regulators last year, including the $35 billion merger between oil-field service groups Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Inc and the $6 billion combination of Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc .

Bill Baer, the former head of the Justice Department's antitrust division who initiated the lawsuit to block the Aetna-Humana deal, called the decision "a strong affirmation of the role that competition plays in health insurance markets."

Doctors and hospitals had urged the Justice Department to block the deal, fearing it would erode their pricing power. Some large employers also opposed the combination.

"Today's ruling is a decisive victory for jobs, consumers, and healthcare. Mega mergers like the proposed consolidation of Aetna and Humana raise prices, lower health care quality   and kill jobs," said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat.

Aetna had offered to sell a portfolio of about 290,000 Medicare Advantage members in 21 states to smaller peer Molina Healthcare Inc for $117 million, but that deal failed to appease Judge Bates.

Read More Earnings: Last Call for Yahoo? Johnson & Johnson, Alibaba Also Release This Week Earnings season kicks into high gear this week with a number of big names reporting. Among the Monday releases, YYahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO) will report what may be its last quarterly earnings numbers, as its pending acquisition by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ), announced in July 2016, moves toward completion.

On Tuesday before the opening bell, pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Chinese e-commerce heavyweight Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) offer up a fresh look at their earnings and revenue figures.

Yahoo Swan Song?

In the previous quarter, some analysts said at the time that they were more interested in what the next chapter of YHOO might look like than they were in the earnings numbers. This time around, in what could be the last quarter that sees YHOO operating as an independent company, the earnings story may not necessarily be the top story either.

Last July, VZ offered $4.8 billion to acquire YHOO s core business. A couple months later, in September, YHOO announced a data breach that may have compromised at least 500 million user accounts. It remains unclear whether the security breach will impact the terms of the deal, which was initially scheduled to close in the first quarter of 2017.

Because of the timing, YHOO has said it will not hold a conference call after the earnings results are announced.

For the quarter, the consensus estimate from analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters Corp (NYSE: TRI) is $0.21 per share, up from $0.13 a share a year ago. Revenue is projected to rise slightly to $1.38 billion from $1.3 billion last year.

The options market has priced in an expected share price move of 4.2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform from TD Ameritrade.

Call activity has been seen at the weekly 43 strike while put activity has concentrated at the 40.50 strike. The implied volatility lies at the 29th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.)

Note: Call options represent the right, but not the obligation, to buy the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time. Put options represent the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying security at a predetermined price over a set period of time.

JNJ s Drug Business

JNJ s baby-care, oral-care and skin-care consumer products are likely crowding the medicine cabinets of many households across the U.S., but since 2014, it is its pharma products that ring up the most revenues. JNJ has a handful of drugs that are either nearing maturity or recently off-patent, but with others having been newly-released, some analysts are watching those numbers carefully.

New product launches of oncology drugs Imbruvica and Darzalex might help grow top-line sales, as might its immunology drugs Stelara and Simponi, as well as blood thinner Xarelto. But as some analysts point out, biosimilar versions of some of these drugs from competitors may have an impact.

These recent launches may help offset declining sales of Olysio, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) treatment, and antipsychotic drug Invega, both of which face growing competition from other name drugs and generic brands.

Analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters are forecasting earnings of $1.56 share, about an 8% increase over the year-ago profit. Revenue is expected to strengthen to $18.3 billion from $17.8 billion a year ago.

The options market has priced in an expected share price move of about 1.7% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform.

Call activity has been seen at the weekly 115 strike, with puts active at the monthly 115 and 110 strikes. The implied volatility sits in the lower half at the 23rd percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.)

BABA s Record Revenues?

The China-based e-commerce giant considered by many to be a proxy for consumption in China is expected by some analysts to deliver record revenues, boosted by better site traffic and purchases, strong growth in its cloud business, and better trends in digital media like the online video-streaming business, Youku Tudou, which was acquired by Alibaba last year.

A handful of analysts have said in recent notes that, based on their proprietary data, they believe BABA s online marketing revenue for China retail business may grow at a rate exceeding 40%. Much of that, they say, looks to be generated from better sales of apparel, household products, and baby, children and maternity items.

Others, meanwhile, say they re expecting businesses like cloud computing and digital media to rise by triple-digit percentage points. Overall, some analysts are forecasting total earnings growth rates in the 30% to 40% range. Some note, too, that the December quarter has typically been a big one, partly because of the Nov. 11 Singles  Day shopping event BABA created in 2009. Last year s extravaganza rang up a record 120.7 billion yuan ($17.55 billion) worth of merchandise that BABA claimed was 32% higher than the year-ago period.

As for the conference call, some analysts say they expect to hear more about BABA s foray into bricks-and-mortar stores as an avenue for greater distribution. Earlier this month, BABA announced that it was working on a deal to become the controlling shareholder of China s Intime Retail Group, which operates 29 department stores and 17 shopping malls.

Other analysts say they are listening for greater insight into BABA s cloud-computing business, which it said had a 130% year-over-year jump in revenue in the quarter that ended in September. Other businesses that BABA could comment on include its digital and entertainment division, which produces romantic comedies along with other programs, and its logistic operations, Cainiao Network.

And then there are the expectations for BABA s partnership with the International Olympic Committee. Last week, BABA announced that it had inked a long-term deal to become the official cloud services and e-commerce platform services, as well as founding partner of the Olympic Channel.

For the quarter, analysts reporting to Thomson Reuters forecast per-share earnings of 7.75 yuan, or $1.13, roughly 21% higher than the year-ago period. Revenue is anticipated to hit 50.3 billion yuan, or $7.32 billion, a near 46% run higher.

The options market has priced in an expected share price move of just over 4.2% in either direction around the earnings release, according to the Market Maker Move  indicator on the thinkorswim  platform.

Call activity has been seen at the weekly 95 and 100 strikes while put have been active at the monthly 95 strike. The implied volatility lies at 30th percentile. (Please remember past performance is no guarantee of future results.)

EBAY will report fourth-quarter 2016 earnings on Jan 25 after the bell. Over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry.

eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise

eBay Inc. Price and EPS Surprise | eBay Inc. Quote

Per our proven model, a stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) to beat estimates. We don t recommend Sell-rated stocks (Zacks Rank #4 or #5) going into the earnings announcement.

However, eBay s surprise history has been much impressive, since the company has beaten estimates in three of the last four quarters and matched estimates on one occasion.

What Happened Last Quarter

eBay s third-quarter earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on revenues that also beat estimates. The results were driven by continuous strong performance across Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds. The company added 1 million active buyers in the third quarter taking the total to 165 million.

What We Are Watching

Last quarter, eBay acquired Corrigon Ltd., which it expects will contribute significantly to its Marketplace platform's structured data initiative. It also closed the acquisitions of Ticket Utils and TicketbiS that are expected to improve seller tools.

The company added Qualcomm, Mattel, Fender and Magic Chef to its strategic brand partner s list to attract more customers to its online properties. It rolled out curated experiences in Fashion, Home and Garden and eBay ShopBot on Facebook Messenger for a better user experience.

StubHub rolled out a combined primary and secondary ticket experience for the Philadelphia 76ers, and enabled users to obtain support through a Skype chatbot. Seller hub continued to drive more engagement from consumer sellers.

eBay sold most of its stake in MercadoLibre, Inc., a move that is expected to realize considerable gain on investment.

Summing Up

eBay s unique capabilities backed by technological improvements give it an edge over competitors. We remain positive about the pace of building a solid foundation of structured data and artificial intelligence, increasing personalizing capacities and enhancing mobile experience.

Zacks Investment Research Yahoo reports Q4 GAAP earnings per share $0.17

Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) Heffx Trading Outlook Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) Heffx Trading Outlook

Overall, the bias in prices is: Upwards.

Short term: Prices are moving.

Intermediate term: Prices are trending.

Note: this chart shows extraordinary price action to the upside.

The projected upper bound is: 44.36.

The projected lower bound is: 40.49.

The projected closing price is: 42.42.

Candlesticks

A big white candle occurred. This is generally considered bullish, as prices closed significantly higher than they opened. If the candle appears when prices are  low,  it may be the first sign of a bottom. If it occurs when prices are rebounding off of a support area (e.g., a moving average, trendline, or retracement level), the long white candle adds credibility to the support. Similarly, if the candle appears during a breakout above a resistance area, the long white candle adds credibility to the breakout.

During the past 10 bars, there have been 6 white candles and 4 black candles for a net of 2 white candles. During the past 50 bars, there have been 26 white candles and 24 black candles for a net of 2 white candles.

An engulfing bullish line occurred (where a white candle s real body completely contains the previous black candle s real body). The engulfing bullish pattern is bullish during a downtrend. It then signifies that the momentum may be shifting from the bears to the bulls.

If the engulfing bullish pattern occurs during an uptrend (which appears to be the case with YAHOO! INC), it may be a last engulfing top which indicates a top. The test to see if this is the case is if the next candle closes below the top of the current (white) candle s real body.

Momentum Indicators

Momentum is a general term used to describe the speed at which prices move over a given time period. Generally, changes in momentum tend to lead to changes in prices. This expert shows the current values of four popular momentum indicators.

Stochastic Oscillator

One method of interpreting the Stochastic Oscillator is looking for overbought areas (above 80) and oversold areas (below 20). The Stochastic Oscillator is 55.5955. This is not an overbought or oversold reading. The last signal was a sell 4 period(s) ago.

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

The RSI shows overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) areas. The current value of the RSI is 64.06. This is not a topping or bottoming area. A buy or sell signal is generated when the RSI moves out of an overbought/oversold area. The last signal was a sell 92 period(s) ago.

Commodity Channel Index (CCI)

The CCI shows overbought (above 100) and oversold (below -100) areas. The current value of the CCI is 59. This is not a topping or bottoming area. The last signal was a sell 6 period(s) ago.

MACD

The Moving Average Convergence/Divergence indicator (MACD) gives signals when it crosses its 9 period signal line. The last signal was a buy 13 period(s) ago.

Yahoo, Verizon Delay Merger Close Connecting decision makers to a dynamic network of information, people and ideas, Bloomberg quickly and accurately delivers business and financial information, news and insight around the world. Verizon stays mum on Yahoo as customer growth rebounds Josh Miller/CNET

No really Verizon, how do you feel about Yahoo?

In Verizon's fourth-quarter report on Tuesday, references to Yahoo, which the telecom giant agreed to acquired for $4.8 billion, are buried near the end with little additional insight.

You could forgive Verizon for being skittish when it comes to talking about Yahoo, a business it once coveted for its user base and media properties, but where it now sees only controversy. While Verizon would say only that it's working with the internet portal to assess the damage from its data breaches, Yahoo said Monday it believes the deal will be consummated despite a delay.

"The opportunities ahead with Verizon look bright," Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer said in a statement.

Verizon was comparatively more terse: "We have not reached any final conclusions yet," Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said on a conference call with analysts.

Those opportunities have probably dimmed a bit from July, when Verizon first announced the planned takeover. Since then, Yahoo has disclosed that it was the victim of the two largest hacks in history, and it is reportedly under investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations that it didn't move fast enough to tell investors about its security problems.

Yahoo was supposed to be the linchpin to Verizon's efforts to transform its business away from that of a mere carrier. It isn't interested in delivering just home internet, TV and wireless services anymore; it wants to take advantage of the exploding ad market by creating content, delivered through a variety of avenues including its mobile app Go90. Yahoo was supposed to bring more than a billion eyeballs for those ads.

When you look at Verizon's quarterly results, it's clear why the New York telecommunications company is so keen to make the change.

Verizon added a net 167,000 new phone customers in the fourth quarter. It's an improvement from the decline of 36,000 phone customers in the third quarter, but still far behind the 933,000 postpaid customers -- people who pay at the end of the month -- that T-Mobile added in the same period.

The results underscore the continuing competitive environment in the wireless business, which was heightened by availability of a new iPhone and related promotions offered by each of the carriers. Verizon had long considered itself above the fray, with its reputation for network quality justifying its premium price. But the results from the last few quarters suggest T-Mobile and Sprint have been successful at picking off subscribers.

Indeed, Verizon had to roll out aggressive promotions to stay competitive, a move that hurt its profits, according to Jeffries analyst Mike McCormack. He noted that overall phone growth was still weaker with the turnover rate higher than expected.

Verizon blamed the higher customer turnover rate on more tablet customers dropping off the service. Many of those customers got free tablets in exchange for a commitment to pay for wireless service, and likely canceled the connection when their commitment period ran out.

For the fourth quarter, Verizon posted a profit of $4.6 billion, or $1.10 a share. Excluding one-time items, earnings were 86 cents a share, compared with 89 cents a year ago. Revenue fell 5.6 percent to $32.3 billion.

The company was slated to earning 89 cents a share on revenue of $32.09 billion, according to Yahoo Finance.

Verizon shares fell 3.6 percent to $50.53 in premarket trading on Tuesday.

The US charged two Russian intel agents and two hackers with being behind the 2014 hack of 500 million Yahoo Inc accounts. This was the first time the U.S. government criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes.

The Justice Department made a 47-count indictment against the two Russians. The paperwork charges the two with conspiracy, computer abuse and fraud and wire fraud, among other crimes.

Yahoo Inc CEO Marissa Mayer and the company s top lawyer faced punishment after two massive security breaches occurred in 2014. The breaches exposed the personal info of over one billion users. The breaches cost Yahoo $350 million so far.

Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer will not receive an annual bonus or stock awards. An internal team found her management team did not act quickly enough once the 2014 breach came to light. The company s general counsel, Ronald Bell, quit without severance pay. Still, the investigative report did not name the negligent executives.

But the report writers blamed Yahoo s legal team for not looking deeply into the breach. We reported before that Verizon Communications Inc will buy Yahoo Inc s core business for $4.48 billion. The amount represents a $350 million decrease after two huge cyber attacks against Yahoo. The companies signed the deal two days ago, after weeks of talks between senior officials. A week ago, the leaders agreed to the deal in principle.

The agreement included a liability sharing agreement. Verizon Communications Inc held brand studies. These studies found that people still held Yahoo in high regard after the hacks. Verizon continued to pursue the deal since it made strategic sense.

The deal will give Verizon more than 1 billion users and a treasure trove of data. Before the deal took place, the companies struggled to reach an agreement. Verizon Communications Inc reduced Yahoo deal amount by $350 million. The original cost totaled $4.8 billion. The smaller amount surprised investors. Still the terms required Altaba to take on future liability for security breaches.

That includes those unknown right now. In fact, Yahoo warned some users of a  forged cookie  attack that happened late last year. Forged cookies permit access to some user info. The hacks spurred lawsuits. Nevertheless, the deal will close by April. Yahoo announced this time frame in the recent past. The company plans to integrate with Verizon s AOL operations.

As we reported previously, Business Insider said Yahoo delayed the closing of its $4 billion plus acquisition deal with Verizon. The internet company cited additional work to meet closing conditions. The company said the deal would wrap up by the first quarter of 2017.

They did not go into detail regarding the delay. However, an inside source said Verizon is working with Yahoo Inc to resolve questions from recent hacks. In addition, both companies continue to work on how to meld their operations together.

But time began to run out when we last reported on the deal. Either company can back out of the deal or extend the process by a quarter. But if the deal falls through, Yahoo Inc will get slapped with a $144.8m fee. A fee it may not be able to afford. That s because fourth quarter revenue came in at $960.1 million.

Yahoo Inc Faced Large Charge

The company cannot afford such a hefty charge based on current revenue levels. The news of Yahoo s 2013 and 2014 hacking incidents set them back quite a bit. The praise comes despite the challenges the company faced in the last year. Verizon reduced Yahoo Inc deal as filings show a bright spot in Yahoo s financials.

Revenue from its mobile, social ads and video section rose to nearly $600 million. Analysts believe the reports show the company can become leaner, but the company s internet search business continues to decline.

Source: Reuters Yahoo Security Lapses Laid Bare Even as Russia Blamed for Hack When it comes to Yahoo s massive security breach, the company was right about one thing.

Yahoo! Inc. has been saying since September that a state-sponsored actor was behind a hack in 2014 that compromised about 500 million of its user accounts, even as some security experts cast doubt on that claim. Yahoo gained a measure of vindication Wednesday when the U.S. government laid out charges against four individuals allegedly acting at the behest of the Russian government when they broke into Yahoo s computer systems.

"The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored," the company said. "We are deeply grateful to the FBI for investigating these crimes and the DOJ for bringing charges against those responsible."

Yahoo is not alone in meeting skepticism for asserting a hacking attack was the work of a foreign government. Companies sometimes make that claim, in some cases to help collect on cyber-insurance payouts or for a waiver from the U.S. government allowing them to keep the incursion secret while it s investigated on national security grounds.

In Yahoo s case, there was also a merger on the line. The company had in July agreed to sell its Internet properties to Verizon Communications Inc., and any evidence that the company had been lax in keeping user data secure might give its new owner cause to revisit terms of the deal. A state-backed attack led by elite hackers, on the other hand, can be more difficult to repel -- or so a company can argue.

"You re pitting U.S. corporations against state-sponsored activity," said Jim Pastore, a member of Debevoise & Plimpton s Cybersecurity & Data Privacy practice and Intellectual Property Litigation Group. "And no matter how good you are as a company, that is an unfair battle."

Even as the indictments show a sophisticated and comprehensive attack, they also reveal new details about the lapses that left Yahoo vulnerable to criticism that it failed to adequately shore up accounts -- and ultimately prompted Verizon to renegotiate terms of its planned acquisition.

The document outlined for the first time how deeply Yahoo s internal systems were compromised by the attackers. Most crucially, the hackers were able to access Yahoo s computers for managing user information, which included the cryptographic values assigned to each user and needed to generate the files known as cookies. These pieces of data can be used to identify a particular user and associate that person s account to Yahoo s servers as well as sites visited across the web. The attackers were able to create their own cookies, thus allowing them to bypass Yahoo s login security protocols for any targeted accounts.

"They come off looking relatively lax on security," said Stephen Beck, founder of management consultancy cg42.

Yahoo had already admitted to missteps, allowing the hackers to access its user database and clone the cookies that let them easily enter and rifle through as many as 32 million accounts without even needing the passwords. And in December, the company announced an earlier and bigger breach, involving 1 billion user accounts, which was discovered by Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer for InfoArmor, a security company, who had been tracking the spammers who orchestrated that incursion.

Yahoo General Counsel Ronald Bell resigned earlier this month after an investigation found his legal team didn t adequately investigate leads about Yahoo s security issues, and Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer wasn t given a cash bonus.

An investigation by Yahoo s board found that senior executives knew about the hacking in 2014 but that it "was not properly investigated and analyzed," the company said in a filing this month. Yahoo notified just 26 people whose accounts were infiltrated.

The board found that "failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling" of the breach, according to the filing.

The Justice Department s revelations Wednesday served to reinforce those findings.

Canadian Man Charged in Yahoo Hack Loves Fancy Cars, Parties The Canadian charged in connection with a massive hack of Yahoo accounts that the United States says was a Russian plot is a young man who has boasted on social media of his wealth and love of expensive cars, online accounts show.

Karim Baratov, a 22-year-old dual Kazakh-Canadian citizen, is fighting extradition to face U.S. charges he was paid by Russian intelligence agents to break into email accounts. The 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo Inc accounts was at the time the largest ever such breach.

Speaking by text message, Baratov's lawyer, Amedeo DiCarlo, said on Friday that his client denies all the allegations. He called Baratov a "political scapegoat" and added he "is healthy and confident."

Canadian police arrested and detained Baratov on Tuesday in Hamilton, Ontario. DiCarlo also spoke to reporters outside the Hamilton court where Baratov was due to appear via video on Friday, adding that a bail hearing was to be set for April 5.

Baratov was one of four people charged in a U.S. Justice Department indictment on Wednesday that portrayed Russian security services as having worked hand-in-hand with cyber criminals in the Yahoo case. U.S. authorities are seeking his extradition and have up to 60 days to prepare their case prior to an extradition hearing; until then, Baratov's arrest is provisional.

Baratov has an extensive presence on social media, especially in online groups devoted to exotic-car aficionados.

On sites including Facebook and Instagram, photos show him posing in front of a string of high-end cars bearing his personalized license plates.

He also boasts of having paid off a mortgage while still in high school and of having sold an internet company for $20 million as a teen. Reuters has been unable to verify either of those claims, and his lawyer did not respond to specific queries about them.

Neighbors said they knew Baratov as a young man who threw parties with attendees' fancy cars stretching up and down the block.

On his Instagram account, Baratov is seen partying in Toronto nightclubs, flexing his muscles and talking about workouts and taking supplements.

Silvia, a 66-year-old retired hospital worker who lives around the corner from Baratov and who declined to give her last name, said that last Halloween he gave her trick-or-treating grandson and other children a fistful of U.S. dollar bills.

"It was weird," she said.

DiCarlo declined to comment when asked what Baratov did to support his lifestyle.

On Thursday, nobody answered the phone or responded to knocks at the door of the two-storey house on Chamber Drive in Hamilton, a city 75 kilometers (45 miles) west of Toronto where Baratov lives.

The Toronto Star newspaper reported that the house had been listed for sale on Monday for C$930,000 ($698,146) but was abruptly de-listed on Wednesday. Neighbors said the "For Sale" sign was taken down the same day.

Two men and a woman who arrived at the house on Thursday and said they were looking to buy the house were shown inside by a man who told Reuters he was brokering a potential sale.

Baratov lives alone in the three-bedroom house, neighbors said, but his parents sometimes visit. They said his father, who was there when Baratov was arrested, helped him move in, in the summer of 2015, and was sometimes was seen shoveling snow from his son's sidewalk. Buy or Sell?

That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 15.37 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company s last quarterly report.

The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For YHOO, the company currently has $1.12 Billion of cash on the books, which is offset by $- current liabilities. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.01 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.08 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 1.77% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

Yahoo! Inc.: YHOO Stock Is Setting Up for a Run By Patrick Brik, BAS Published : January 6, 2017

YHOO Stock: A Breakout Is Imminent

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) stock is setting up to make a bullish move, and I have been waiting for Yahoo stock to complete a price pattern that will indicate when the next run is set to take place.

This is the same pattern that I highlighted in my previous publication regarding Yahoo stock, on November 29, 2016. Over a month has passed and Yahoo stock continues to trade within the confines of this pattern. I am beginning to lose patience, so this probably means that a resolution to this pattern is only moments away.

For those not familiar with my work, I use technical analysis to analyze potential investments and create investment strategies. Technical analysis uses past volume and price data to discern trends and forecast future prices. The method of analysis is timely and has been instrumental in quantifying my level of risk.

The following Yahoo stock chart illustrates the pattern that I continue to watch.

Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com

The YHOO stock chart above is a perfect example of a healthy bullish trend.

The bullish trend began in early February when YHOO stock surged off of the lows in a swift and linear motion. This surge in price is highlighted in green in the above chart, and is what traders refer to as an impulse wave. The sideways trading action that followed, highlighted in purple, is what traders refer to as a consolidation wave.

Directional trends are littered with this type of price action, and both types of waves are dependent on each other. Impulse waves take a price to new heights and consolidation waves serve to alleviate any overbought conditions and set up the next advancing impulse wave. This cycle can continue for prolonged periods as long as the trend remains orderly.

Shortly after this bullish trend began, a golden cross was generated in mid-April. A golden cross is a bullish signal that is produced when a 50-day moving average, highlighted in blue, crosses above a 200-day moving average, highlighted in red. This signal acts to confirm that a bull market is now in progress. It is not uncommon for a price to accelerate after such a signal is given, as many traders give a lot of credence to it.

Yahoo stock did not accelerate in price right after this signal because it was still in the process of completing a consolidation wave. In mid-July, the price exited the consolidation wave, marking it complete, and the acceleration in price began as an impulse wave took YHOO stock on a run just shy of $45.00.

After this high was created, a consolidation wave followed, which is serving to alleviate any overbought conditions and potentially set up the next bullish move.

The current consolidation wave is different than the consolidation wave that came before it. This wave is downward-sloping so, as time progresses, the price continues to drop. YHOO stock has now retraced the entire previous impulse wave and has returned to test the the resistance level that contained the price inside the previous consolidation wave.

If a bull market in YHOO stock is going to continue, it is imperative that Yahoo stock does not fall below this level. The price needs to exit the current consolidation wave in short order, to preserve the bullish price action that has dominated the landscape.

In order to preserve the bullish landscape, Yahoo will not only need to exit the channel, but there is also the 50-day moving average that has refuted any price advances.

Luckily both levels currently coincide around one price, so a break above both levels would probably involve some fireworks and would also indicate that another impulse wave is finally in development.

Bottom Line on YHOO Stock

I continue to wait for the completion of a particular pattern on the Yahoo stock chart. In order for the landscape to remain bullish, YHOO stock must resolve this pattern with a bullish breakout. This breakout must occur soon, as time is running out. Article Names Medical Marijuana, Inc. and AXIM(R) Biotech as Two of "10 ... SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwired - January 06, 2017) - Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTC PINK: MJNA), the first publicly traded cannabis company in the United States, today announced that the Company was featured in a recent High Times article, "10 Largest Marijuana Companies Raking in Huge Profits."

Using data from well-respected firm Viridian Capital Advisors, a group of Wall Street analysts and bankers focused on cannabis investing who also maintain a cannabis stock index, the article listed the 10 largest U.S.-listed companies by market cap -- nine of which were biotech/Pharmaceutical companies.

CEO, Dr. Stuart Titus. "We applaud the news media for covering developments on the financial side, and for savvy investors who are starting to look into the fastest-growing sector in the US."

Yes, in case wringing your hands over the tax man weren t enough, criminals are out there trying to swipe your hard earned cash and personal information from right under your nose.

Luckily, there are a few ways to spot these scams and protect yourself.

Fake IRS phone calls

One of the most common scams out there today is the IRS phone call. It usually goes something like this. You get a call from someone claiming to be from the IRS. They say you haven t paid your taxes properly and owe Uncle Sam some serious cash. The scammer will then demand that you pay them immediately or they ll send the feds over and have you arrested.

That s some pretty scary stuff right there, especially if you have no idea what you re doing when it comes to your taxes, and live in constant fear that you screwed up your last filing and are on the hook for thousands of dollars in fines.

The truth, though, is that the IRS will never contact you over the phone. What s more, they won t demand that you pay on the spot. The government actually gives you an opportunity to appeal the amount you owe.

And despite how scared you might be of the government, the IRS will never threaten to send in  Johnny Law  to arrest you for a first time tax problem. It should also go without saying that the feds will never ask for you to pay your taxes in gift cards. Yes, that s seriously something criminals have done.

Phony IRS emails

These are just like those fake IRS phone calls, but in email form. Unfortunately, these can be even more convincing fakes, as they include things like official-looking IRS logos and the like.

Heck, I actually received a phony email from Britain s version of the IRS, HM Revenue & Customs. Considering I live in Queens, New York, and not the U.K., though, that scam artist clearly wasn t the brightest bulb in the bunch.

Outside of trying to get trick you out of your cash, these emails also come with the added risk of malware and ransomware if you download any files from them or click on any embedded links.

TL;DR: If you get a random email from the IRS, it s not from the IRS.

W2 scammers

This one specifically targets companies  payroll and human resources departments. The scheme works like this: Criminals send an email impersonating a company s CEO or other executive officer to that organization s payroll or HR professionals asking for personal information about employees.

According to the IRS, which issued a warning about this scam in January, criminals will request items like employee names, Social Security numbers and income data. The scammers will then try to file fraudulent tax returns in order to receive refunds.

According to a report by Sophos  Naked Security Blog, Snap, Inc. fell for this exact scam back in 2016.

The non-existent federal student tax

Have you ever heard of the federal student tax? No? Good, because the IRS says there s no such thing. But that doesn t stop criminals from trying to trick people into believing there is such a tax and that they need to pay up for it now.

This works at the same way as the standard IRS scam. Victims receive a phone call or email from criminals impersonating the IRS telling them that they haven t paid their student tax and that if they don t they ll be arrested or fined.

The crooks will then demand that the victim pays via their credit or debit card or with gift cards. Basically, if anyone tells you they re trying to collect on the federal student tax, tell them to take a hike.

Verifying tax information

This particular scam sees criminals asking victims to verify items like the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, as the IRS said scammers attempted to do last year in the Washington, D.C. area, or other tax information. The scammers could also ask items like your bank account information or your full Social Security number.

Remember, the IRS won t ask you for any such information over the phone. If the person is impersonating a tax preparer or preparation agency, your best bet is to hang up and call your actual tax agent or send your real tax professional an email asking if they need your information.

Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) to Buy Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) at Discount Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) will still buy Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO ) after all, but the price of the company is considerably lower.

The two companies had announced that the details of the data breach had slowed down the final details of the acquisition that will see Yahoo s operations being added to the largest carrier in the U.S., based on number of subscribers.

More negotiations continued and it was determined that Verizon would acquire the Internet giant for $250 million less than what the original deal dictated. The carrier was going to acquire Yahoo for $4.8 billion.

The deal is expected to be completed sometime during the second quarter of 2017. The deal also ensures that the leftovers of Yahoo s operations from the deal will be renamed Altaba Inc. and the combined company will have to deal with the legal responsibilities linked to the breaches.

The announcement of the new deal will come in days or weeks, according to people close to the matter. The new agreement has yet to be finalized and could still change.

Verizon had 143.9 million subscribers as of the third quarter of 2016, which is nearly 15 million more than the next carrier.

The breach in question occurred in 2013 when hackers acquired e-mail addresses, dates of birth and passwords that were scrambled. More than 500 million accounts were affected.

VZ stock is down 0.7% Wednesday, while YHOO shares gained 1.2%.

More From InvestorPlace Verizon 'close' to deal cutting $350 MILLION from Yahoo's price following ... Verizon Communications Inc is close to a revised deal to buy Yahoo Inc's core internet business for $250 million to $350 million less than the original agreed price of $4.83 billion, according to a source briefed on the matter.

Since last year, Verizon had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from two cyber attacks.

Another person familiar with the situation said the price cut was likely to be around $250 million, a figure that Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.

Since last year, Verizon had been trying to persuade Yahoo to amend the terms of the acquisition agreement to reflect the economic damage from two cyber attacks.

YAHOO'S HACK Yahoo began looking into the hack in August, before it was officially announced in September that a 2014 attack compromised the names, email addresses, telephone numbers, birthdays, encrypted passwords and security questions of its users. The internet firm said it learned of the breach this summer while investigating claims of a separate intrusion, but it has not provided a specific timeline of events. The data breach is still under investigation, and FBI officials confirmed there were signs of a 'state-sponsored' attack.

'In addition to the discount, Verizon and the entity that remains of Yahoo after the deal, to be called Altaba Inc., are expected to share any ongoing legal responsibilities related to the breaches, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing private information,' Bloomberg said.

An announcement of the new agreement could come in a matter of days or weeks, it claims.

Yahoo and Verizon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Verizon hopes to combine Yahoo's search, email and messenger assets, as well as advertising technology tools, with its AOL unit, which Verizon bought in 2015 for $4.4 billion.

Verizon has been looking to mobile video and advertising for new sources of revenue outside an oversaturated wireless market.

Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo has been under scrutiny by federal investigators and lawmakers since disclosing the largest known data breach in history.

Craig Silliman, general counsel at Verizon, acknowledged the hack's potential financial repercussions last year, saying: 'I think we have a reasonable basis to believe right now that the impact is material.'

Yahoo shares rose 1.6 percent to $45.76 in morning trading.

Verizon shares fell 0.7 percent to $47.96.

Critics called on its $36million-a-year boss Marissa Mayer to quit after hackers reportedly sold the stolen data on the 'dark web'.

His role in the company is to increase the profile of Ziyen Inc. in Iraq, establish a good working relationship between Ziyen Inc. and the local and national governments in the country and act as the senior authorized representative of the company in Iraq.

Based in Baghdad, Mohammed formerly worked as a diplomat whose experience spans several decades while he held posts in China. In addition, he was involved with the Iraqi Mission to the United Nations.

This led to the launch of the New Economist in 1998, which was the very first economic English and Arabic language newspaper in Iraq and is still currently in publication today with Mohammed as its Editor in Chief.



Ziyen Inc. CEO Alastair Caithness adds:

 We are extremely excited Mohammed has agreed to join Ziyen s Board of Directors and the knowledge, contacts and experience he brings to Ziyen in relation to operating in Iraq. In spite of the current political and financial problems that are happening in the country, we believe it is important to restore the economic power of the future to Iraq and provide opportunities for the Iraqi people to rebuild their country. Mohammed brings a priceless insight into the current state of the economy, oil and gas industry, Healthcare, Finance and IT industry sectors in Iraq. We are very much looking forward to working with Mohammed.

Yahoo Stock (YHOO) Update: Time For A Trend Change? Yahoo Stock (YHOO) Update: Time For A Trend Change?

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) has been in the news a lot over the past few years. Whether it be acquisitions, speculation about being acquired, operations, or valuation, it s been covered.

And with the stock under pressure into 2016, the news wasn t always cheery.

But if we look at a long-term linear chart of Yahoo stock (YHOO), we can see that shares have rallied sharply since bottoming last February. And they are now testing the downtrend line from the 2000 stock top.

It remains to be seen whether Yahoo can flip the script, so to speak.

But it is clear that this is a critical juncture for the stock. YHOO tested this downtrend line just last September and failed to breakout. Does it have the oomph this time?

Outthinking Activist Investors: 3 Rules for Corporate Boards The hottest topic in many corporate boardrooms today is shareholder activism   or more specifically, the vulnerability of becoming the target of a shareholder activist and what to do about it. Instead of dreading this or, worse, have to defend against it, boards of directors should be proactive about getting out ahead of it. As insiders, we are in a better position to act on our fiduciary responsibility to represent the interests of shareholders than is an independent party, and we have more tools and power at our disposal to do so. Done right, this might result in some healthy, but managed changes.

The influence the activists are having in the market has never been greater. Simply put, what they are doing is attracting more interest and more capital, now estimated at north of $115 billion, ten times the levels of the 1990 s. Distributing their messages has also become easier. They often communicate via social media and business news channels like CNBC to emotionally pressure management and collaborate with other shareholders.

So what is a board of directors to do? Boards are empowered to protect shareholders, but many shareholders have become sympathetic to activists because they believe the system has inherent conflicts of interest; that directors are more interested in collecting paychecks and preserving their status quo than in exercising their fiduciary duty to shareholders.

Conversely, the board s time horizon for creating value is by definition much longer than that of any one activist, and many boards and management teams feel activists are too short-term and just don t get the complexities of the landscape in which they operate. Operating realities include balancing the interests of customers, suppliers, employees, and regulators. Implementing well-managed changes, while navigating these factors, often takes longer than investors may realize.

But there are many things public company boards can do to better align with their core responsibility to the stockholders and they can do it in a way that is proactive and more long-term in nature than if it is in response to an activist.

Here's three ideas that boards of public companies can consider. They are meant to be directional rather than prescriptive; possible plays in a playbook.

Let shareholders air it out. Most boards receive input from reading reports by sell-side analysts, who are not their shareholders, and from the CEO and CFO, who directly talk to institutional shareholders. Imagine, as an executive, never meeting with your boss to get feedback, but instead receiving it filtered from someone on your staff. That s essentially what happens for most boards.

The shareholders are ultimately the  boss  of the board in the sense that the board serves as their proxy for enhancing intrinsic value, yet boards typically hear about shareholder concerns indirectly and often not attributed to any specific shareholder.

A huge opportunity is missed without direct contact. This is exactly the opportunity the activists are availing themselves of by contacting blocks of shareholders to exchange views on underperforming companies and collaborating on remedies.

Boards should do the same. There are a variety of ways to accomplish this. For example, Coca-Cola Co. Director Maria Elena Lagomasino, Chair of the Compensation Committee, met directly with one large shareholder and also considered specific summarized feedback derived from major institutional shareholders of Coke ( ko ) on the issue of executive compensation. This input led to the revised approach to equity compensation, communicated by her directly with shareholders through the company s website.

This could even become part of a regular process. For example, a designated board member could invite large shareholders to periodic get togethers to air their thoughts and concerns. This feedback could either be summarized for the board by that board member or delivered directly by a representative from the group at a board gathering.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. ( brk ) is even more ambitious. It hosts more than 30,000 shareholders in Omaha annually and allows them more than six hours to ask unfiltered questions. Recently, Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett offered some sage advice on the subject.  I believe in running the company for shareholders that are going to stay, rather than the ones that are going to leave. 

If a designated director or a designated third party representing the board were to reach out to shareholders from time to time, both sides would learn and benefit. It would allow key directors to educate shareholders, as well as build credibility and a relationship before problems arise. In addition, shareholders can add insight to the board, because they often speak with competitors, customers, and suppliers of the company and can bring an  outside in  perspective that can be hugely valuable.

Limit terms, but don t install terms limits. This means setting up a mechanism for both attracting new directors with some of the skill sets of long-term shareholders, as well as a mechanism for rotation off the board to create room for new thinking, more diversity, and women.

For removing directors, the solution that activists primarily advocate is a hard term-limit. As an alternative, many companies instead opt for a retirement age. I am not a fan of either. Why create a system that force out good board members?

Then again, most boards have at least one or maybe a few directors who are not adding as much value as a new member might bring and therefore represent an  opportunity cost.  Once directors are on a board, it can be extremely difficult to naturally rotate them off. Firing a friend is tough under the best conditions, and even more so because there is no economic incentive. It s emotionally easier just to  wait it out.  This is even more complicated when a CEO inherits a board that was picked and groomed by her predecessor and doesn t have the collective skills for her new strategy.

My view is that boards would be well served to adopt a process that specifically outlines the rotation process and that is understood and implemented for new directors. In other words, limited terms, but not term-limits. By making this change for all new directors, it side-steps the issue of those already on the board, making it easier to implement on a go forward basis.

I lean toward a system in which each new member of the board agrees to hand in their resignation every six to eight years, with the idea being that some directors will be asked to serve multiple terms it they are uniquely qualified to help the CEO and company build value, but most will be thanked for their service and move on after that time frame.

The decision regarding whose resignations to keep, or whose to accept, could be made either by an appointed director, or by an absolutely confidential and binding majority vote of the other board members. This latter approach might be easier socially.

Think like an activist. Directors must insist on asking management to analyze strategic choices as an activist would: by looking at alternatives to the strategies the CEO is recommending. This is not typical. The more common pattern is for the CEO to consider options and present only the chosen one to the board.

The road not taken is the one the activist will surface so the board must have analyzed these alternatives. This means understanding what it would mean to get out of underperforming operations, split up the company and evaluate varying alternatives for measuring and handling excess cash versus the ones being recommended. If these choices are not discussed, the board will be poorly prepared to articulate and defend its alternative course.

Importantly, an analysis of the break-up or private transaction value of a company that shows a higher value than where the stock is trading does not oblige a company to make a sale. There have been many times in history where macro-economic or other conditions have made the current stock market and private transaction values poor indicators of intrinsic value. The board s duty is to enhance the latter, exercising its duty of care, by fully understanding what strategic choices the company is making and why.

Buyers of options and volatility may find these prices more attractive than at other times. The Bears And Bulls Square Off On Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has presented a rich pool of technical data in recent sessions. These are the trends we ve been tracking and how we feel they should be played in the current environment. The best way to gauge the future price movement of a stock is to look at historical chart data and map a course for the future. Gathering this data is best done by combing through the technical data and a mix of indicators.

Recent trading for (YHOO) has highlighted key trends upon which sound decisions can be based. The levels established for its relative 50 and 200 SMAs have suggested that the current trend is bullish. The current trend established by the SMAs also highlight the level of investor interest as the stock makes its way across varying levels of risk and upside potential. This has further created a general positive trading atmosphere. Current trends have also fed into volume levels which have seen weak buying and selling sentiments, reflecting the general indifference of interested parties across the broadest trading and investing spectrum. Combined these sentiment-based indicators and trends point to potential deeper impacts on cross-related technical factors capable of influencing overall upside.

The deeper test for the directional thrust of a stock is measured through two very important indicators: Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures. Both indicators offer up the distilled wisdom of whether the stock is oversold or overbought, i.e. are the sellers dominating activities, or are the buyers doping the bulk of the movement. For (YHOO) the 14-day RSI is 67.55% this indicates that on the balance of traditional RSI measures, the stock is neutral   neither overbought nor oversold and therefore not susceptible to any undue price movements in either direction. The stochastic picture offers up another powerful indicator of potential price movement for (YHOO). Stochastic data amassed over the past 30 days highlights a score of 82.05%. This indicates that the stock is overbought at current levels.

Sometimes true trading successes occur when other indicators are used in a quasi-supporting role in establishing a trading picture, or to fully establish the shape of the trading environment. Short-term movement for (YHOO) has offered up some interesting dynamics. Its +1.67 price change has produced positive change over the past 30 days. Longer term the stock has outperform the S&P 500 by 16.96%. This performance has come on the back of consistently higher daily volatility when matched against other stocks trading on the same exchange. Recent momentum has been largely informed by a historical volatility of 10.12%. This level of volatility is indicative of the speed (rate of change) of the underlying stock price and is therefore a helpful gauge at a glance. The risk-implied volatility is also being showcased via the average true range, currently 1.35. Keep in mind that ATR does not account for price direction therefore professional traders always utilize the price chart in tandem with the ATR indicator. Technicals in Focus for Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) We have gathered the technical data on Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), and see some interesting trends in the stock s behavior of late. It is said that  everything is in the price  that all fundamental and sentiment information is best communicated by the action on the chart. For this stock, that chart has a great deal to say about what may be to come.

YHOO has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.

For market timers, it s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 67.55%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock s last month of action shows a score of 82.05%. Based on a raw data interpretation, the stock is relatively overbought from this perspective.

As professionals know, risk is best understood through a measure of volatility in an investment vehicle. In recent action, YHOO has made a move of +1.67 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 16.96%, and it s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 10.12%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.3%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.

As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the  golden ratio  of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $33.93 sits at $38.92. YHOO also has additional support below at the stock s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $41.48.

YHOO INVESTOR ALERT: The Law Offices of Vincent Wong Reminds Investors of a ... NEW YORK, March 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Law Offices of Vincent Wong announce that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the USDC for the Northern District of California on behalf of investors who purchased Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) securities between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016.



Click here to learn about the case: http://www.wongesq.com/pslra/yahoo-inc. There is no cost or obligation to you.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo! disclosed that hackers stole information in late 2014 on more than 500 million user accounts. This news drove the price of Yahoo! shares down more than 3 percent. Then, on December 14, 2016, Defendants disclosed that in August 2013 hackers stole information on more than 1 billion user accounts. This news drove the price of Yahoo! shares down more than 6 percent.

Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes. Still A Value Trap?   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), ConocoPhillips (COP) Shares of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) are on a recovery track as they have regained 37.84% since bottoming out at $33.93 on Mar. 24, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 0.43% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 20.95% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -0.49% from $47.16 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 20, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 32.98% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s shares projecting a $47.63 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.74%, and the sector s average is 4.5%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -13.29% since hitting a peak level of $53.17 on Dec. 13, 2016. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -5.13% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -8.05% so far on the year   still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 22.85% higher from $38.19, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Apr. 05, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 16.31% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $45.86, COP has a chance to add $12.04 or 26.25% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($57.9) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.14 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, ConocoPhillips s EPS growth has been nearly -20.7%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but more headwinds are coming as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go down by 0%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. ConocoPhillips s ROE is -9.67%, while industry s is -9.07%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 9.24%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. COP s ROA is -3.8%, while industry s average is -2.91%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 2.48.

Russian Agents Accused by US of Masterminding Yahoo Hack Watch Next: U.S. Accuses Russian Agents of Masterminding Yahoo Hack (Video)

U.S. Accuses Russian Agents of Masterminding Yahoo Hack

The U.S. government accused Russia of directing some of the world s most notorious cybercriminals to break into computer systems, namely a half-billion accounts at Yahoo! Inc., in a broad scheme that married illicit profits and intelligence gathering.

The broadside against the Russian government appeared in an indictment unsealed Wednesday in San Francisco federal court alleging a widespread conspiracy by two Russian FSB security agents and a pair of hackers. One of the hackers was arrested in Canada. While the U.S. government has little chance of getting the others extradited from Russia, it used the announcement to make a public and detailed case that Moscow is orchestrating criminal hacks and shielding those who commit them.

 We have reason to believe, based on our evidence, they were acting in their capacity as FSB officials,  said Mary McCord, acting assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice s national security division.

Prosecutors outlined a scheme of economic espionage, wire fraud and theft of trade secrets, accusing the two Russian agents of conspiring with a hacker in the 2014 breach of Yahoo. The other hacker, a Kazakh-born Canadian citizen, is accused of targeting people inside Russia in related information-gathering schemes.

Details of the 2014 Yahoo hack, and another breach of the company in 2013, threatened to derail its pending acquisition by Verizon Communications Inc. and ultimately led to a lower proposed purchase price.

The U.S. indictment appears to pull back the curtain on the use of criminal hackers by Russia s spy agencies to attack key U.S. targets, including the largest purveyors of web-based email, Google and Yahoo. Russian intelligence agents are able to recruit some of the country s best hackers by threatening them with charges if they don t cooperate, according to the U.S. indictment. The FSB agents sheltered one of the accused hackers from prosecution and gave him sensitive information that helped him evade international law enforcement, it said.

Together, the conspirators gained unfettered access to operate inside Yahoo s network. Breaching a database of at least 500 million Yahoo email accounts, they looked for people of political interest and keywords in ordinary people s accounts that would make them vulnerable to financial fraud.

They also stole the secret cryptographic values that Yahoo assigns to each user for generating cookies, the files on a person s computer that contain details of their login history. The attackers then generated their own cookies, bypassing passwords and tricking Yahoo s server into letting them into accounts, ultimately stealing contents of 6,500 Yahoo accounts.

  The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored  as the company had initially disclosed,   said Chris Madsen, an assistant general counsel for security and law enforcement at Yahoo. Shares of the company finished 0.2 percent lower in Wednesday trading, to $46.29.

Spy Agencies

The list of hacking victims in the U.S. was diverse, including the White House and its military and diplomatic corps. Conspirators also reaped information on a swath of global companies and their executives, including a U.S. financial services company, an airline and a private equity firm, the U.S. said, without identifying them.

It s the second instance in recent months in which the U.S. accused Moscow of using cyberattacks to undercut U.S. institutions. Justice Department officials said Wednesday there was no link between the Yahoo case and a national security probe into Russian interference in the U.S. presidential election.

A Putin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, didn t directly address the charges against Russian security officials but said Moscow was interested in cooperating with the U.S. to combat cyber threats. The press office for the FSB, the main successor to the Soviet KGB that is known formally as the Federal Security Service, didn t answer phone calls.

Washington didn t contact Moscow over the allegations, a senior Russian official told Russia s Interfax news agency. The unidentified official dismissed the topic as part of an internal U.S. political struggle.

Ratcheting Up

The U.S. government has been ratcheting up pressure on Russian hacking networks over the last few months. In December, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Russians -- Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev and Aleksey Alekseyevich Belan  - for engaging in  malicious cyber-enabled activities.  The announcement was made as President Barack Obama took steps against Russia for attempting to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.

One of those hackers, Belan, was charged in the Yahoo case. He has been charged twice previously for cyberattacks of technology companies.

The U.S. indicted Igor Sushchin, who it said worked for the FSB and specialized in cyber investigations, and Dmitry Dokuchaev, described as a hacker for hire who was pressed into working for the FSB to avoid prosecution for bank-card fraud. The indictment said Dokuchaev worked with an FSB unit known as  Center 18,  the point of contact for the U.S. s Federal Bureau of Investigation for probes into cybercrimes. He was detained in December by Russian authorities and accused of  interacting  with U.S. intelligence.

The defendants couldn t immediately be reached for comment.

The U.S. alleged that the fourth man, Kazakh-born Canadian citizen Karim Baratov, helped gather information on Russians in league with the FSB. He was arrested Tuesday by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and awaits an extradition hearing. Amedeo DiCarlo, a lawyer in Hamilton, Ontario, said he had been retained by Baratov s family to defend him and declined to comment on the case.

Bounty Payment

Belan was already an accomplished hacker and international fugitive when the Yahoo hack began in 2014. He had been indicted twice in the U.S. for defrauding e-commerce sites, and in 2013 landed on the FBI s Cyber Most Wanted List. The U.S. wanted poster identified him as a Russian-speaking Latvian operating under multiple aliases (Magg, M4G and Moy.Yawik) and possibly traveling in disguise. In late 2013, he fled to Russia after being arrested in Europe on a U.S. warrant, the Justice Department said.

Working with Dokuchaev and Sushchin, Belan pilfered Yahoo accounts to line his own pockets: He stole gift card and credit card numbers, earned commissions by fraudulently redirecting Yahoo search traffic and mounted a spam campaign using his access to 30 million emails, according to the indictment.

The FSB agents also paid him to gather intelligence, the U.S. said. The Yahoo email accounts he breached almost certainly provided sensitive personal data to Russia s increasingly unpredictable spy agencies.

The FSB agents directed hacking that stretched beyond the U.S., as well. They enlisted Baratov to target some critics of the Russian government, including journalists and politicians, a board member and senior officer of a Russian financial firm, and a senior officer of a Russian email provider, the indictment said. In one mission, the hackers were instructed to compromise Google accounts belonging to an officer of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and a training expert for Russia s Sports Ministry.

Russian Targets

As outlined by the U.S. government, Baratov was paid to gain access to 80 email accounts, including 50 Google accounts. He mounted spear-phishing attacks, used fake emails to compel targets to provide sensitive information and sold passwords he obtained to Dokuchaev.

Google declined to comment.

The U.S. is seeking forfeiture of funds held in a PayPal accounts controlled by Baratov and Dokuchaev, and two luxury cars -- a gray Aston Martin DBS with a  Mr. Karim  vanity plate and a black Mercedes Benz C54.

Earlier Breach

The 2014 hack outlined in the U.S. indictment was the second major breach of Yahoo s systems in recent years. In December, the company said user data had been stolen from more than 1 billion accounts in August 2013. The company said in a filing this month that it wasn t able to identify the intruders associated with that breach.

A Bloomberg News review of the trove purloined in that attack showed that the hackers had obtained access to email accounts of at least 150,000 people working across the U.S. government -- in intelligence, the military, the White House and on Capitol Hill. Such a leak could allow a foreign intelligence service to identify employees and hack their personal and work accounts for surveillance or blackmail.

The 2013 breach was discovered by Andrew Komarov, chief intelligence officer for InfoArmor, who had been tracking a prolific Eastern European hacker group that he spotted offering 1 billion Yahoo accounts for $300,000 in a private sale.

By watching the group s communications, he was able to determine that it sold the database three times. Two buyers were large spamming groups. The third buyer provided a list of 10 names of U.S. and foreign government officials and business executives to verify that their logins were part of the database, Komarov said. The unusual request, Komarov said, indicated that the buyer might be linked to a foreign intelligence agency.

It s unclear whether the 2013 Yahoo hack has any connection to the subsequent one now attributed to the Russians. The earlier intrusion is still under investigation, a U.S. official said Wednesday.

Yahoo reveals details of Verizon deal negotiations Just days after Yahoo Inc. reassured regulators and investors the company s $4.5-billion deal with Verizon Inc. was on solid footing, new details surfaced about a major hack that has dogged the former tech giant for six months.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice revealed charges against four men who allegedly hacked Yahoo users in 2013 and 2014. The indictment said the four alleged hackers   three Russians and a Canadian   had nearly free rein inside Yahoo s system at the peak of the hacks. The charges opened yet another chapter in an extended drama that has complicated efforts to sell the Internet pioneer.

In July, 2016, Yahoo announced the sale of its core Web business for $4.8-billion. By September, it was dealing with the revelation that hackers had potentially breached hundreds of millions of user accounts. In October, reports surfaced that Verizon was seeking a billion-dollar discount on the deal. By December, the number of affected users had climbed closer to a billion. In February, reports said the purchase price would be cut by about $350-million (U.S.).

This week, the company revealed that the hit could have been much worse. In a filing on Monday with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Yahoo unveiled details of negotiations in which the company talked Verizon down from a desired price reduction of $925-million. It also said Marissa Mayer, Yahoo s once-hailed chief executive officer, had been offered $23-million in severance to make way for a new CEO, about half the amount she was to receive before the hack.

When news of the price reduction began circulating in mid-February, some analysts expressed surprise that it was not more   and that the deal was still on at all.

 The fact they are closing the deal at any price is really good,  Laura Martin, a senior analyst with investment-service firm Needham & Company, said at the time. In the past months, Yahoo s shares have been trending higher, closing at $46.29 on Wednesday   up more than 20 per cent since the middle of December. Some analysts predict a $52 share price for the entity, which will be renamed  Altaba  once the deal with Verizon is completed.

Still, uncertainty looms about Yahoo s liability for continuing costs related to the hacks, which have so far totalled more than $16-million. The SEC is also investigating whether Yahoo breached its fiduciary duty to shareholders by not disclosing the hacks when they first learned of them. Altaba will retain 100 per cent of the liability for any related litigation.

Meanwhile, at least two-dozen class-action and other lawsuits are in the works from consumers, including one by Merchant Law Group LLP representing Canadian users. Part of the amended agreement stipulates Altaba and Verizon split any costs associated with consumer lawsuits that come after the deal closes.

Another area of potential liability is with Yahoo s advertiser partners and clients, who could make a claim based on allegations that they too were defrauded. According to the Justice Department indictment:  One of the defendants [Alexsey Alexseyevich Belan, 29, also known as Magg, a Russian resident] also exploited his access to Yahoo s network for his personal financial gain   redirecting a subset of Yahoo search engine web traffic so he could make commissions. 

In 2005, Yahoo paid $4.95-million to settle a case that alleged it did not do enough to protect against click fraud. In 2006, Google paid $90-million to settle a click-fraud case.

Finally, there is the underlying financial performance of the unit Verizon is buying. In January, Yahoo s 2016 revenue was reported at $5.17-billion (a slight improvement after falling from $6-billion in 2010 to less than $5-billion when Ms. Mayer took over in 2012), of which $1.4-billion was for mobile ad sales, and $3.4-billion from desktop. The combined Web business has about a billion global monthly users, but represents only about 1.3 per cent of the mobile ad market, according to eMarketer. Still, ad sales volume increased 4 per cent, and cost-per-click of search ads was up 18 per cent.

It is a much leaner operation than the one Ms. Mayer took over: In 2016 alone, 18 per cent of Yahoo s work force was cut, leaving 8,500 people, down from 11,700 in 2012.

By comparison, Verizon brought in $126-billion in revenue in 2016 and has more than 160,000 employees.

Report Typo/Error Drilling Down Into the Charts for Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) We have gathered the technical data on Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), and see some interesting trends in the stock s behavior of late. It is said that  everything is in the price  that all fundamental and sentiment information is best communicated by the action on the chart. For this stock, that chart has a great deal to say about what may be to come.

YHOO has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.

For market timers, it s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 64.40%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock s last month of action shows a score of 73.17%. Based on a raw data interpretation, the stock is relatively overbought from this perspective.

Sometimes, there is information carried in simply the degree of movement in a stock. In recent action, YHOO has made a move of +0.91 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 21.01%, and it s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 12.32%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.4%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.

As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the  golden ratio  of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $33.00 sits at $38.35. YHOO also has additional support below at the stock s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $41.30. Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO): Some of the key technical areas With all other things going on, Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) has been on a run   rising 11.04 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Yahoo! Inc. a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.

Let s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment s value to increase over time. So is with Yahoo! Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $1.63 below YHOO s recent stock price. That s the optimistic view from Wall Street.

The stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 38.09% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.

The company s share price is down -1.36% from previous highs of around $47 per share on March 13, 2017. On the bright side, the company s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 46.21% since hitting lows of $32.83 on March 16, 2016.

Finally, from a technical perspective, there s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $45.87 and $46.12. In terms of pullbacks, $46.69 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Yahoo! Inc. RSI was seen at 65.11. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.

With these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for YHOO is 72.95. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses. )

14-day Williams %R for Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) moved to around 30.73. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought. Federated Investors Inc.

Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level.

Attorney advertising. Prior results do not guarantee similar outcomes. Technicals in Focus for Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) We have gathered the technical data on Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), and see some interesting trends in the stock s behavior of late. It is said that  everything is in the price  that all fundamental and sentiment information is best communicated by the action on the chart. For this stock, that chart has a great deal to say about what may be to come.

YHOO has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.

For market timers, it s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 62.88%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock s last month of action shows a score of 66.03%. Based on a raw data interpretation, this perspective doesn t suggest either an overbought or oversold condition.

As professionals know, risk is best understood through a measure of volatility in an investment vehicle. In recent action, YHOO has made a move of +1.00 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is underperforming the S&P 500 by 24.83%, and it s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 13.83%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.6%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.

As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the  golden ratio  of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $29.80 sits at $36.26. YHOO also has additional support below at the stock s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $40.76.

Top Research Reports for Friday: HD, MDT, KHC

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Home Depot Inc. (NYSE: HD   Free Report ), Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT   Free Report ) and Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ: KHC   Free Report ).

Home Depot shares have gained +15.61% over the last year, more than the Zacks Building Products - Retail industry, which has gained +12.06% over the same period. Improving customer experience, solid execution and consistent housing market recovery helped the company post better-than-expected bottom-line results for fourth-quarter fiscal 2016, retaining its four-year long trend of beating earnings estimates.

Home Depot initiated a robust guidance for fiscal 2017 and updated its capital allocation strategy, which called for a higher long-term dividend payout target of 55% of net earnings. (You can read the full research report on Home Depothere. )

Medtronic shares have underperformed the Zacks categorized Medical - Products industry over the past one year, gaining +4.17% vs +12.49%. A mixed second-quarter fiscal 2017 result in November coupled with lowered guidance for fiscal 2017 is discouraging, indicating slim of recovery down the line. However, Medtronic s recent tie-up with Fitbit in diabetes care may have a positive impact on the company. It s consistent growth across all groups and regions are also encouraging. Recent FDA approvals may also boost the company. (You can read the full research report on Medtronic here. )

Kraft Heinz has outperformed the broader sector in the past one year, while its fourth-quarter 2016 earnings and revenues beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company s overall organic sales growth for the said quarter was commendable, while margins also improved.

The company s move to raise its three-year integration cost savings target to $1.7 billion from $1.5 billion is also appreciable. But, the company s net sales declined 3.7% year over year because of lower sales across all segments. (You can read the full research report on Kraft Heinzhere. )

US companies decry Trump action on transgender student rights NEW YORK: U.S. companies led by tech firms Yahoo Inc, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp criticized the Trump administration's decision to revoke Obama administration guidance that allowed transgender public school students to use the bathroom of their choice.

Their statements evoked the opposition expressed by many businesses last year when the state of North Carolina passed a law that forces transgender people to use public restrooms matching their gender assigned at birth.

The resulting boycotts have cost North Carolina more than US$560 million in economic activity, according to the online magazine Facing South.

Companies lacked the same opportunity to protest with their dollars in this instance, since the Trump administration action pertains to schools, but still signaled they stood with the Obama policy of using the federal government to expand transgender civil rights.

"It's ultimately going to come down to the business community to stop it because it's so bad for business," said Christopher Gergen, chief executive of Forward Impact, an entrepreneurial organization based in Raleigh, North Carolina.

In unveiling the new direction on Wednesday, Trump administration officials argued that transgender policies should be an issue for the states to decide.

"The action taken by the administration is troubling and goes against all that we believe in," Yahoo said in a statement.

Social conservatives have hailed the decision by the Justice and Education departments to defer transgender bathroom policies to the states, calling it a victory for privacy and traditional values.

But companies have tried to persuade state and local governments to side with transgender people.

"We support efforts toward greater acceptance, not less, and we strongly believe that transgender students should be treated as equals," Apple said in a statement.

Microsoft President Brad Smith looked to history as a guide, referencing the date that the Emancipation Proclamation took effect, when President Abraham Lincoln declared freedom for slaves.

"Since Jan. 1, 1863, the federal government has played a vital role in protecting the rights of all Americans. Let's not stop now," Smith said on Twitter.

Twitter and Square CEO Jack Dorsey joined other tech firms criticizing the Trump administration's position.

"Rolling back rights for transgender students is wrong," Dorsey said in a tweet on Thursday. "Twitter and Square stand with the LGBTQ community, always."

In response to the North Carolina law, companies such as Deutsche Bank and PayPal canceled expansion plans, costing the state jobs.

By invoking states' rights, the Trump administration is potentially emboldening legislatures in other states that are considering laws similar to North Carolina's HB2.

Yahoo earnings preview: Nothing really matters Yahoo Inc. is scheduled to release its latest round of quarterly and full-year earnings on Monday, but nobody really cares.

While fourth-quarter results are typically important for Yahoo YHOO, +1.66% as online advertising can peak around the holiday shopping season, the company s core internet business already has a price tag that is unlikely to change due to these numbers. Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.25% has agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo, and the factor that could change that price is not financial results but embarrassing hacks that have accessed large caches of Yahoo user data.

That $4.8 billion is factored into Yahoo s current market capitalization of more than $40 billion, with the rest spun off into an entity that will be called Altaba if or when the Verizon deal is complete. The future Altaba will largely be unaffected by Yahoo s fourth-quarter results, though, and could see more movement from the Tuesday earnings report of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, +2.49% as stock in the Chinese e-commerce company is a main component of Yahoo s leftovers.

In accordance with the low-key nature of the results and the nonfinancial storm swarming Yahoo at the moment, the company plans to release earnings after the market closes Monday and not hold a conference call. Barring an announcement about the Verizon deal or more information about the latest disclosed hack, expect the silence around this report to be deafening.

Here's what Trump means for the tech industry (1:34) The incoming Trump administration has given Silicon Valley a headache, mainly due to potential plans to penalize companies that manufacture goods in China. But not all of Trump's proposed policies may have a harmful effect on the tech sector.

However, since MarketWatch is a full-service financial-news organization, here is what to expect:

Earnings: Analysts on average expect Yahoo to report net income of $120 million, or 11 cents a share, according to FactSet. After adjustments for stock-based compensation and other factors, analysts project profit of 21 cents a share. Contributors at Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, expect profit of 22 cents a share.

Those results would shine in comparison to last year s fourth quarter, when Yahoo announced a $4.5 billion impairment charge and reported GAAP losses of $4.70 a share, though adjusted profit without the charge was reported as 13 cents a share.

Revenue: FactSet reports that analysts on average expect Yahoo to report total revenue of $1.38 billion, which falls to $908 million after subtracting traffic-acquisition costs, the money Yahoo pays to partners to drive eyeballs to Yahoo properties. Estimize contributors project ex-TAC revenue to hit $910.3 million.

In the same quarter last year, Yahoo reported total revenue of $1.27 billion, and revenue minus TAC of $1 billion. Those results kept alive an 11-year streak of $1 billion-plus quarters, but it died in the first quarter of 2016 and Yahoo has not hit that mark since.

Stock reaction: Yahoo stock has gained after earnings in each of the past three quarters, though as noted above, the stock has moved more on other factors than actual Yahoo core performance for a while. Before that recent streak, Yahoo had fallen after its earnings report in five consecutive quarters and eight of the previous 10.

Overall, Yahoo stock has declined 1% in the past three months and gained 45.8% in the past year, while the S&P 500 SPX, +0.07% has increased 5.7% and 21.8% in the same time periods. Of 27 analysts tracked by FactSet, 11 rate Yahoo the equivalent of buy while 16 rate the stock as a hold, with an average price target of $41.99. Why You Should May Want to Buy Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Ahead of Earnings Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and Yahoo! Inc. ( YHOO ) may be one such company.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.

That is because Yahoo! is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings   with the most up-to-date information possible   is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for YHOO in this report.

In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 15 cents per share for YHOO, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 14 cents per share.

This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for YHOO, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of 7.14% heading into earnings season.

A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10 year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).

Given that YHOO has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Yahoo!, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.

Yahoo Inc. (YHOO): Free Stock Analysis Report

To read this article on Zacks.com click here. Yahoo Japan defies calls to halt ivory sales as poaching soars Yahoo Japan, the country s biggest online auction site, is rebuffing calls to end online ivory trading despite Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer s misgivings over facilitating a business blamed for the illegal slaughter of African elephants.

Yahoo Japan doesn t accept that ivory sold on its platform   supposedly imported into Japan before a 1989 ban on international shipments   is a factor behind the sharp rise in poaching on the African savannah in recent years.

Dismissing animal rights campaigners  concerns, even though the ivory business contributes only a fraction of its sales, Yahoo Japan also says that as long as no laws are broken people should be able to trade whatever they like on the internet.

 We want to provide an internet auction site where people can trade freely, and at this moment we have no intention of banning legal trading without any reason,  a spokesman for Yahoo Japan said.

 We don t believe the ivory sales contribute to a fall in elephant numbers,  he added.

A count of African elephants   the main source of poached ivory   showed the population had fallen to less than 380,000 in 2014.

With their numbers dropping around 30 percent between 2007 and 2014, African elephants are on the World Wildlife Fund s vulnerable list.

Meantime, sales of ivory via Yahoo Japan have risen exponentially.

In 2015, 28,000 ivory pieces were traded on Yahoo Japan, more than seven times as much as a decade earlier, including 438 whole tusks, according to a recent report by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA).

Ivory is traditionally used in Japan to make hanko (carved name seals). But because much of Japan s ivory is unregistered, wildlife groups say Japan provides an opportunity for unscrupulous traders to register poached ivory for sale to Chinese traders.

China said two weeks ago it will ban the domestic trade by the end of 2017, shutting the door to the world s biggest market for poached ivory.

Rakuten disallows tusks

Yahoo Japan rival Rakuten Inc., which recently agreed to become FC Barcelona s sponsor, still allows ivory sales on its site, but has stepped back from sales of whole tusks, a spokesman for the company said.

California-based Yahoo, which bans the sale of endangered animal products, says it can t force Yahoo Japan to change. Mayer has not publicly addressed the issue, though she has let it be known that she has raised concerns internally.

 Marissa has met up dozens of times with Yahoo Japan on this issue,  said a source with knowledge of the meetings.  Sometimes it s engagement with board members and sometimes it s meetings with the CEOs,  he added.

The Yahoo Japan spokesman confirmed that Mayer has met its CEO, Manabu Miyasaka, but declined to give details of the talks.

Ron Bell, a counsel for Yahoo, issued a statement last year describing the relationship with Yahoo Japan as one of  passive ownership. 

Aside from having its brand above the door, Yahoo has a 35.6 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, second only to the 36.4 percent owned by the Softbank Group controlled by billionaire businessman Masayoshi Son.

In Japan, shareholders who own more than a third of a company s stock have the right to veto board decisions.

The U.S. company declined to comment further when asked whether it would consider taking action.

Yahoo Japan declined to say how much it earned in commissions from online ivory sales. But EIA estimated it was $7 million in 2015, constituting just a tiny part of the $5.52 billion in revenues Yahoo Japan reported for the 2015-16 financial year.

Laundering ivory

Only registered ivory shipped before the 1989 ban on exports under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species can be traded in Japan.

At a CITES meeting in September, 182 countries approved a nonbinding proposal to end domestic trading that animal rights groups say has spurred a revival in poaching.

Japanese officials, however, have so far said they are reluctant to stop trading on Yahoo Japan or elsewhere because they believe only preban ivory is traded.

 If you closed down a well-established market like Japan it would not stop the killing. It would drive the market underground,  said a spokesman from the Environment Ministry.

Nobody, however, knows how much ivory came to Japan before 1989 or how much remains unregistered, raising suspicions about shipments to China.

 Regrettably, that makes us vulnerable to criticism,  said the official from the ministry, which estimates there is about 2,000 tons of ivory in Japan, of which only 300 tons is registered.

That registration and accompanying third-party confirmation are subject to few checks to stop poached ivory from entering the market, animal rights groups say.

 The third-party requirement is the problem; even family members are allowed,  said Masayuki Sakamoto, an official at EIA.  It is kind of official laundering.  Tucows Inc. To Acquire eNom from Rightside -- Combined Entity Will Be The Second Largest Domain Registrar In The World --



TORONTO, Jan. 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Tucows Inc. (TCX) (TC.TO), a provider of network access, domain names and other Internet services, announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire wholesale domain name registrar eNom from Rightside Group, Ltd. (NAME). The transaction is expected to close later today.

Tucows will pay $83.5 million and the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings. The acquisition will be funded through an amendment increasing Tucows  existing credit facility to a total of $140 million.

The acquisition of eNom will add 14.5 million domains under management and 28,000 active resellers. That will give Tucows a total network of over 40,000 resellers globally and 29 million domains under management, making it the second largest domain registrar in the world.

 For years, eNom and OpenSRS have been the two leading registrars primarily focused on the needs of resellers. This focus means these businesses fit very well together,  said David Woroch, Tucows  Executive Vice President of Domains.  The acquisition keeps eNom resellers where they will be well understood, well valued and well served and creates tremendous value for Tucows and resellers on both sides through efficiency and scale. 

Elliot Noss, Tucows  CEO added,  This industry has changed so much since Tucows and eNom each launched wholesale registrar services over fifteen years ago and .com, .net and .org essentially represented the namespace. It is a lot more challenging and complex now. At the same time, it is more mature and much more competitive. Scale is absolutely critical. This is a rare deal that gives Tucows and its investors exactly that while offering an immediate cash on cash return. 

NOTE TO INVESTORS: We know that releasing this transaction on a Friday morning, especially this particular Friday morning, is not ideal. We apologize for that. These things sometimes cannot be helped.

Conference Call

Tucows management will host a conference call today, Friday, January 20, 2017 at 11 am (ET) to discuss this announcement. Participants can access the conference call by dialing (888) 231-8191 or (647) 427-7450 or via the Internet at http://www.tucows.com/investors.

Specifically, the defendants are alleged to have made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Yahoo failed to encrypt its users  personal information and/or failed to encrypt its users  personal data with an up-to-date and secure encryption scheme; (ii) consequently, sensitive personal account information from more than 1 billion users was vulnerable to theft; (iii) a data breach resulting in the theft of personal user data would foreseeably cause a significant drop in user engagement with Yahoo s websites and services; and (iv) as a result, Yahoo s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed that hackers had stolen information in late 2014 on more than 500 million user accounts. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell $1.35 per share, or over 3%, to close on September 23, 2016 at $42.80 per share.

Then, on December 14, 2016, Yahoo announced an additional data breach and reported that data from more than 1 billion user accounts had been compromised in August 2013. Further, Yahoo disclosed that,  [f]or potentially affected accounts, the stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.  Following this disclosure, The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering ways to amend the terms of its deal with Yahoo to reflect the impact of the data breach and would likely seek  major concessions  from Yahoo. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell an additional $2.50 per share, or over 6%, to close on December 15, 2016 at $38.41 per share.

Finally, on January 23, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into the timing of Yahoo s disclosures regarding the data breaches.

Yahoo shareholders may, no later than March 27, 2017, petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

View source version on businesswire.com: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170322005410/en/ Users accuse Yahoo! Inc. of lax security measures SAN FRANCISCO (Legal Newsline)   Users have filed a class action lawsuit against Yahoo! Inc., citing alleged breach of implied warranty, breach of warranty, negligence and unfair competition.

Matthew Ridolfo and Deana Ridolfo filed a complaint Feb. 7 on behalf of similarly situated individuals in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against Yahoo! Inc., alleging that the corporation failed to keep their users personal information safe from any security breaches.

According to the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that Matthew Ridolfo and Deana Ridolfo suffered damages from having their personal information stolen from their email account. The plaintiffs holds Yahoo! Inc. responsible because the defendant allegedly failed to keep adequate security measures to ensure that their user's personal information is kept safe from date security breaches.

The plaintiffs request a trial by jury and seek enjoin the defendant, award compensatory, exemplary, and statutory damages, interest, disgorgement, restitution, all legal fees, interest, and any other relief as this court deems just. They are represented by Lee A. Cirsch, Robert K. Friedl and Trisha K. Monesi of Capstone Law APC in Los Angeles.

U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Case number 3:17-cv-00619-MEJ The Unified Clarity of The Technical Chart For Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Is Amazing Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has created a compelling message for traders in the most recent trading. That message has grown stronger as the technical chart setup has developed into a more composite picture for the stock. This is the breakdown as we see it. Contrary to popular belief, ignorance is not bliss. What you don t know can actually harm you; and if you are a day trader, $1 worth of ignorance could potentially cost you $100 in real wealth. Traders that succeed know this; which is why many don t take on any trade unless they listen intently to what the technical chart has to say.

The 50 and 200 SMAs for YHOO have created a marked trend which is now helping traders to make solid decisions regarding the stock. It s a trend that is now unmistakable. Based on the trend levels presented by both indicators, the overall sentiment towards YHOO is best described as bullish. This trend has created a unified opinion across the trading floor and it is clear that the overall outlook for the stock is now established as positive. But it s not just the outlook that s being affected for the stock. Thanks to the consolidated opinion on YHOO, activity has also seen a pronounced trend. Under current sentiments the volume activity and subsequent trend has created a weak outlook from buyers and sellers. Sentiments have a tendency to either weaken or strengthen as other technical factors begin to influence overall outlook. It s interesting to see how things are playing out for YHOO. It is unsurprising in the case of YHOO, that the current trend has created some indifference among traders regarding the stock. In terms of consistency, it is clear that both the 50 and 200 SMAs have done their job in bring traders the overall trend-picture currently being seen for YHOO.

There is of course more to the tale than just what the SMAs have presented. For those added details, we can take a look at the Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures, both of which give deeper insights into the overall sentiment of buyers and sellers. SMAs will tell alert you to price direction, but when it comes to judging what buyers and sellers are doing, few indicators are better than RSI and the Stochastic. It as this level of technical data that a trader can determine whether a stock is currently overbought is oversold. The current picture for YHOO is of course very telling based on these two additional measures. Based on current readings, YHOO s 14-day RSI is 51.53%. Taken on the standard scale of measurement for RSI, this suggests that YHOO is neutral, suggesting that the stock is relatively stable in terms of price movement up or down. The stochastic reading offers another solid measure of whether the stock is either overbought, or oversold. In the case of YHOO, Stochastic readings gathered over the last 30 days have created a score of 66.80%. This suggests YHOO is neither overbought or oversold at prevailing levels.

Forming any judgment on YHOO purely through the technicals outlined above, whilst not fatal, may cause some problems. This is because there are other technical factors that help paint the overall picture for the stock. By this point in the analysis of YHOO, it is clear that other technical indicators are saying essentially the same things. Specifically the +0.27 has birthed a positive overall sentiment when measured over the previous 30 days or so of trading. Over the longer-term YHOO has outperform the S&P 500 by 12.51. This has, unsurprisingly, created higher volatility levels when compared with similar stocks of the same grade and class. Historical volatility is no less consistent. The historical volatility picture for YHOO is shown in the reading of 12.66%. YHOO has clearly shown its full hand by the overall input of these technical indicators. But there is one final measure that when added to the already rich mix, shows in full color what YHOO is doing. The indicator is the Average True Range, and based on the current 1.46 reading, YHOO is certainly worth paying attention to.

The implied stock swing risk from the option market is significantly tighter in the next 30 calendar days for Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) than it has been on average for the year.

 

 

 

 

 

 

+20.6%

Further, if we look backwards, the stock has a realized 30-day historical volatility, called the HV30, of 12.14%.We have an unusual situation now where the IV30 is substantially depressed relative to the past, but even with that risk pricing, the option market reflects the likelihood of more stock movement in the next 30-days than it has in the last 30-days. Let's turn to a chart to see what's going on.The YHOO risk rating is at 2.5, where the rating goes from one (the lowest risk) to five (the highest risk).

The Dirty Secret to Trading salesforce.com, inc. (CRM), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Shares of salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) are on a recovery track as they have regained 24.28% since bottoming out at $66.43 on Dec. 02, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 1.28% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 20.6% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -2.27% from $84.48 , the 52-week high touched on May. 26, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 11.82% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to buy salesforce.com, inc. (CRM) s shares projecting a $96 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

CRM s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 29.9% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 26.8% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, salesforce.com, inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 2.14%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 13.6%, and the sector s average is 4.65%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -1.21% since hitting a peak level of $47.19 on Mar. 21, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 0.82% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 20.56% so far on the year   still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 33.01% higher from $34.62, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Mar. 29, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 6.71% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $46.62, YHOO has a chance to add $1.01 or 2.17% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($47.63) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.4 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.66 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Yahoo! Inc. s EPS growth has been nearly -17.9%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 3.88%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Yahoo! Inc. s ROE is -0.71%, while industry s is 16.43%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 10.13%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. YHOO s ROA is -1.23%, while industry s average is 9.95%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 8.12. Top Stock Movers- Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN) Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) traded at a yearly high level of $47.19 during the last trading session. The last session s volume of 3.45 million shares was lower than its average volume of 6.53 million shares. The stock, after opening at $46.80, closed at $46.62 by scoring -0.34%. The total market capitalization remained at $44.96 billion.

The stock showed weekly upbeat performance of 0.04%, which was maintained for the month at 0.82%. Likewise, the positive performance for the quarter was recorded as 20.37% and for the year was 26.65%, while the YTD performance remained at 20.56%.

Its last month s stock price volatility remained 1.29% which for the week stands at 1.26%. The share price has moved forward from its 20 days moving average 0.81% and positively from its 50 days moving average 3.10%.

Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), after opening at $115.29, closed at $114.30 by scoring -1.03%. The last session s volume of 1.69 million shares was lower than its average volume of 2.52 million shares.

The stock was able to keep return on assets at 2.70% in the trailing twelve month while Reuters data showed that industry s average stands at 7.21% and sector s optimum level is 6.43%.

Turning to market valuation, the P/E ratio is 48.13, the P/S ratio is 2.62 and the P/B ratio is finally 73.27. The stock is up 32.79% in this year through last close, and the beta ratio has a value of 1.87. Wynn Resorts  shares closed the day on a positive, to trade at $115.49, a 0.27% increase from the previous day s value. There is no denying the Raiders  move to Las Vegas will have a desirable effect for the casino industry. The plans to build a 65,000 capacity stadium are at the implementation stage, with the Raiders having already met the $750 million budget. Speaking to Wall Street Journal, Chief Executive Steve Wynn called the move  a game changer .

The upsurge in stock prices in the industry is expected to continue, with industry experts speculating a positive reaction by shareholders; both current and potential.

The average of this ratio is 14.37 for the industry and sector s best figure appears 10.63. Yahoo! Inc.

Its share price has risen 20.20% in three months and is up 1.56% for the last five trades. The average analysts gave this company a mean recommendation of 2.40. What's Fueling Investor Confidence?   Welltower Inc. (HCN), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Shares of Welltower Inc. (NYSE:HCN) are on a recovery track as they have regained 21.02% since bottoming out at $59.39 on Nov. 10, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 3.31% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 7.38% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -8.31% from $80.19 , the 52-week high touched on Aug. 01, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 8.17% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Welltower Inc. (HCN) s shares projecting a $70.33 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

HCN s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 26.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 4.7% looks unattractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Welltower Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at 17.01%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 41.93%, and the sector s average is 27.17%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -0.87% since hitting a peak level of $47.19 on Mar. 21, 2017. Thanks to an increase of almost 2.45% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 20.97% so far on the year   still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 33.62% higher from $35.05, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Mar. 29, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 7.86% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $46.78, YHOO has a chance to add $0.85 or 1.82% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($47.63) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.4 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.66 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Yahoo! Inc. s EPS growth has been nearly -17.9%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 3.88%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Yahoo! Inc. s ROE is -0.71%, while industry s is 17.59%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 10.23%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. YHOO s ROA is -1.23%, while industry s average is 10.19%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 8.14. Traders Watch list: Yahoo!

Shareholder Class Action Filed Against Yahoo! Inc. - YHOO RADNOR, Pa., Jan. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP announces that a shareholder class action lawsuit has been filed against Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) ("Yahoo" or the "Company") on behalf of purchasers of the Company's securities between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016, inclusive (the "Class Period").

Investors who purchased Yahoo securities during the Class Period may, no later than March 27, 2017, petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class. For additional information or to learn how to participate in this action please visit https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/yahoo-inc#join.

Yahoo shareholders who wish to discuss this action and their legal options are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP (Darren J. Check, Esq., D. Seamus Kaskela, Esq. or Adrienne O. Bell, Esq.) at (888) 299-7706 or at info@ktmc.com.

Yahoo is a multinational technology company that provides a variety of internet services including a search engine, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, advertising and fantasy sports. As of February 2016, Yahoo had an estimated 1 billion monthly active users. On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications, Inc. ("Verizon") formally announced its intent to acquire Yahoo's internet business for $4.8 billion.

The shareholder class action complaint alleges that Yahoo and certain of its executive officers made a series of materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company's business, operations and prospects to investors during the Class Period. Specifically, the defendants are alleged to have made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Yahoo failed to encrypt its users' personal information and/or failed to encrypt its users' personal data with an up-to-date and secure encryption scheme; (ii) consequently, sensitive personal account information from more than 1 billion users was vulnerable to theft; (iii) a data breach resulting in the theft of personal user data would foreseeably cause a significant drop in user engagement with Yahoo's websites and services; and (iv) as a result, Yahoo's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed that hackers had stolen information in late 2014 on more than 500 user million accounts. On this news, Yahoo's share price fell $1.35 per share, or over 3%, to close on September 23, 2016 at $42.80 per share.

Then, on December 14, 2016, Yahoo announced an additional data breach and reported that data from more than 1 billion user accounts had been compromised in August 2013. Further, Yahoo disclosed that, "[f]or potentially affected accounts, the stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers." Following this disclosure, The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering ways to amend the terms of its deal with Yahoo to reflect the impact of the data breach and would likely seek "major concessions" from Yahoo. On this news, Yahoo's share price fell an additional $2.50 per share, or over 6%, to close on December 15, 2016 at $38.41 per share.

Finally, on January 23, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into the timing of Yahoo's disclosures regarding the data breaches.

Yahoo shareholders may, no later than March 27, 2017, petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member's claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

Alibaba Gets Alter Ego With Altaba Alibaba will closely watch the performance of the newly minted Altaba over the next 1-2 years, and could make a privatization bid with Softbank if it feels the company is undermining its own stock.

The biggest of those will be a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, which is worth another $8 billion, and a small portfolio of patents.

Yahoo formally disclosed the listed company that bears its name will formally become known as Altaba after the sale of its Internet assets to Verizon closes.

Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) co-founder Jerry Yang never would have dreamed a decade ago that the ground-breaking search engine he co-founded might someday morph into a Chinese e-commerce company called Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). But that's pretty much what has just happened, with official word from Yang's former baby that it will change its name to Altaba following the pending sale of its core Internet business.

This particular twist has a bizarre and just slightly surreal feel to it, since Yahoo was still a global powerhouse when it invested a then eye-popping $1 billion for 40 percent of a small Chinese e-commerce company called Alibaba back in 2005. But the tables have reversed since then, and what's left of Yahoo's original Internet business is being sold to leading US mobile carrier Verizon (NYSE:VZ).

Meantime, Alibaba has become a Chinese juggernaut controlling more than half of the country's booming e-commerce market. If Yahoo still held its 40 percent of the company, that stake alone would be worth nearly $100 billion. But it has gradually sold down that stake and now holds about 15 percent, which is still worth a sizable $36 billion.

All of that brings us to the present and the latest headlines, which have Yahoo formally disclosing the listed company that now bears its name will formally become known as Altaba after the sale of its Internet assets to Verizon closes (English article). No official explanation was given for how the name was derived in a stock exchange filing by Yahoo, and some Chinese are jokingly saying the name sounds like the equivalent of "father of Alibaba" in Mandarin.

But a more plausible explanation being given by unnamed sources in some western reports says the new name is a combination of the words "alternative" and "Alibaba." The idea is that this new stock would be an alternative for tracking the value of Alibaba's value beyond Alibaba's own New York-listed stock.

Or course, that's a slight oversimplification, since the new company will own a few other assets besides just the 15 percent Alibaba stake. The biggest of those will be a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, which is worth another $8 billion, and a small portfolio of patents. But since its largest assets by far are the two sizable stakes in publicly listed companies, it is probably fair to say one could use the new stock as an alternative for tracking Alibaba's value.

Mouse that Roared

Much has already been written about the "mouse that roared" nature to this twist of events. I remember writing about the original Yahoo purchase back in 2005, when some were saying how the US company was overpaying for the little-known Alibaba at that time. Of course, those people aren't saying anything now, as Alibaba has emerged as one of the world's most valuable Internet companies thanks to its savvy bet on an explosion in China's e-commerce market.

All of that said, a more interesting question is what's in store for this newly minted company, which won't formally get its new name until the sale of Yahoo's Internet business closes. I've previously predicted that Alibaba might try to buy back the stake, since it's quite flush with cash and has access to billions more in credit to fund such a transaction.

But Alibaba has gone on the record saying such a deal is not in the cards, since it would subject the company to a huge tax liability. But that said, the company has quite a lot of cash resources at its disposal and could certainly afford such a tax bill.

Never is a long time, and I would wager that Alibaba will closely watch what happens to the new Altaba once it begins trading under its new name and asset composition. If Alibaba doesn't like what it sees, or feels Altaba stock is becoming a distraction to its own stock, it might well team up with Yahoo Japan owner Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) to try and privatize the company in the next 2-3 years. Such a move would be somewhat costly, but would simplify Alibaba and thus make it more attractive to investors over the longer term.

TOKYO/SAN FRANCISCO Yahoo Japan, the country's biggest online auction site, is rebuffing calls to end online ivory trading despite Yahoo Inc CEO Marissa Mayer's misgivings over facilitating a business blamed for the illegal slaughter of African elephants.

Yahoo Japan doesn't accept that ivory sold on its platform - supposedly imported into Japan before a 1989 ban on international shipments - is a factor behind the sharp rise in poaching on the African savannah in recent years.

Dismissing animal rights campaigners' concerns, even though the ivory business contributes a fraction of its sales, Yahoo Japan also argues that so long as no laws are broken people should be able to trade whatever they like on the internet.

"We want to provide an internet auction site where people can trade freely, and at this moment we have no intention of banning legal trading without any reason," a spokesman for Yahoo Japan said.

"We don't believe the ivory sales contribute to a fall in elephant numbers," he added.

A count of African elephants - the main source of poached ivory - showed the population had fallen to less than 380,000 in 2014.

With their numbers dropping around 30 percent between 2007 and 2014 , African elephants are on the World Wildlife Fund's vulnerable list.

Meantime, sales of ivory via Yahoo Japan have risen exponentially.

In 2015, 28,000 ivory pieces were traded on Yahoo Japan, more than seven times as much as a decade earlier, including 438 whole tusks, according to a recent report by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA).

Ivory is traditionally used in Japan for carved  hanko  name seals. But because much of Japan's ivory is unregistered, wildlife groups say Japan provides an opportunity for unscrupulous traders to register poached ivory for sale to Chinese traders.

China said two weeks ago it will ban the domestic trade by the end of 2017, shutting the door to the world's biggest market for poached ivory.

SECOND LARGEST STAKE

Yahoo Japan rival, Rakuten Inc, which recently agreed to become FC Barcelona's sponsor, still allows ivory sales on its site, but has stepped back from sales of whole tusks, a spokesman for the company said.

California-based Yahoo, which bans the sale of endangered animal products, says it can't force Yahoo Japan to change. Mayer has not publicly addressed the issue, though she has let it be known that she has raised concerns internally.

"Marissa has met up dozens of times with Yahoo Japan on this issue," said a source with knowledge of the meetings. "Sometimes it s engagement with board members and sometimes it s meetings with the CEOs,  he added.

The Yahoo Japan spokesman confirmed that Mayer has met its CEO Manabu Miyasaka, but declined to give details of the talks.

Ron Bell, a counsel for Yahoo, issued a statement last year describing the relationship with Yahoo Japan as one of "passive ownership."

Aside from having it's brand above the door, Yahoo has a 35.6 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, second only to the 36.4 percent owned by the Softbank Group controlled by billionaire businessman Masayoshi Son. In Japan shareholders that own more than a third of a company's stock has the right to veto board decisions.

The U.S. company declined to comment further when asked whether it would consider taking action.

Yahoo Japan declined to say how much it earned in commissions from online ivory sales. But EIA estimated it was $7 million in 2015, making just a tiny part of the $5.52 billion revenues Yahoo Japan reported for the 2015/16 financial year.

LAUNDERING IVORY

Only registered ivory shipped before a 1989 ban on exports under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) can be traded in Japan.

At CITES meeting in September, 182 countries approved a non-binding proposal to end domestic trading that animal rights groups say has spurred a revival in poaching.

Japanese officials, however, have so far said they are reluctant to stop trading on Yahoo Japan or elsewhere because they believe only pre-ban ivory is traded.

"If you closed down a well-established market like Japan it would not stop the killing. It would drive the market underground," said a spokesman from the Japan's Ministry of the Environment.

Nobody, however, knows how much ivory came to Japan before 1989 or how much remains unregistered, raising suspicions about shipments to China.

"Regrettably, that makes us vulnerable to criticism," said the official from the environment ministry, which estimates there is about 2,000 tons of ivory in Japan, of which only 300 tons is registered.

That registration and accompanying third party confirmation is subject to few checks to stop poached ivory entering the market, animal rights groups say.

"The third party requirement is the problem, even family members are allowed," said Masayuki Sakamoto, an official at EIA. "It is kind of official laundering."

Daniel Wellington Tops Inc. Magazine's 3rd Annual Ranking Of Europe's Fastest ... NEW YORK, Feb. 22, 2017 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- Swedish watches and accessories retailer Daniel Wellington was the fastest growing entrepreneurial company in Europe over the past three years, topping Inc. Magazine's third annual Inc. 5000 Europe list.

The Inc. 5000 Europe represents the only comprehensive look at what may be the most dynamic segment of the world's economy: fast-growing private companies.

Daniel Wellington boasted an astounding 4,695% growth rate over the past three years. They are joined by an impressive collection of closely-held companies that represent innovation, determination, and endurance across a number of fields, including Supercell (Finnish maker of the "Clash of Clans" app), UK's Allied Wallet (global fin-tech and e-commerce), Leap Group (Dutch retailer of Apple products), and France's Le Petit Vapoteur (online retailer of bespoke vaping flavor and accessories) .

The 2017 Inc. 5000 Europe list, unveiled this week on Inc.com [http://www.inc.com/inc5000eu], includes infographics and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria. It serves as a unique report card on the European economy. Within an uncertain economic climate, latest aggregate revenue among the companies on the list actually increased to  90.3 billion, up from  20.7 billion in 2012, with a median three-year growth rate of 331 percent.

The list features an amazing group of thriving businesses growing at breakneck speed over the past three years:

In aggregate, Inc. 5000 Europe companies grew 333+% over the past three years, generating new annual revenue of  69 billion.

To make the top 500, a company had to have achieved a remarkable three-year growth of 962%.

Of the 38 countries included in this pan-European list, Spain, Italy and Sweden fielded the most companies.

This year's list also offers rare insight into which industries fared the best during a difficult stretch for Europe's economy. With an average growth rate of 665%, Software ranked as the fastest-growing industry, followed by Environmental Services, at 525%. Financial Services is the top industry by total revenue ( 13.1 billion), and Construction featured the most honoree companies making the list.

"The Inc. 5000EU recognizes companies that have made a major contribution to their economies by advancing the causes of entrepreneurship, innovation and job creation. All too often these essential companies work in obscurity because they are not publicly traded," says Inc. President and Editor-In-Chief Eric Schurenberg. "They no longer have to. The Inc. 5000EU finally gives credit where it is due. Taken in its totality, the Inc. 5000 Europe reminds us that the U.S. does not have a monopoly on entrepreneurship. More than ever, ingenuity, creativity, and tenacity know no boundaries   certainly not geographic ones."

The entire listing of the 2017 Inc. 5000 Europe appears at inc.com and key highlights are featured in Inc.'s March issue, which is available in both tablet and magazine formats.

The Inc. list made its debut in 1981 as a ranking of the 100 fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. The following year, it expanded to 500 companies and, in 2007, the Inc. 5000 was inaugurated. Companies such as Microsoft, Zappos, Clif Bar, Intuit, Chobani, Zipcar, Oracle, and many other well-known names gained early exposure as members of the Inc. 500. Through each evolution, Inc. has sought to recognize and to celebrate the creativity, dedication, and hard work that entrepreneurs put into building their companies.

Complete results, including infographics and an interactive database that can be sorted by industry, region, and other criteria, can be found at Inc.com/inc5000eu.

Methodology

The 2017 Inc. 5000 Europe is ranked according to percentage revenue growth when comparing 2012 to 2015. To qualify, companies must have been founded and generating revenue by March 31, 2012. They had to be European-based, privately held, for profit, and independent not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies as of December 31, 2015. (Since then, a number of companies on the list have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2012 is  200,000; the minimum for 2015 is  2 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons. The full Inc. 5000 Europe list can be found at http://www.inc.com/inc5000eu.

Read More Exclusive: Inside the ugly breakup of Sports Illustrated, The Cauldron, and ... Earlier this month, Sports Illustrated abruptly ended its partnership with The Cauldron, an independent sports blog that had a modest but devoted readership, and had made waves with a number of viral posts written by pro athletes like Steph Curry. The breakup was covered in straightforward fashion by a few sports and media blogs.

But there s much more to the story: impersonations, fake emails, and a forged term sheet.

It is a convoluted tale, but it s worth climbing down this rabbit hole. It s the tale of a sports media acquisition gone very wrong, and how the broken deal ensnared a number of big-name media companies and venture capital firms (in New York, California, and even China) along the way.

The Cauldron launched on the publishing platform Medium in June 2014; Medium shared revenue with The Cauldron based on traffic and engagement time. The site s founders were Jamie O Grady, a Wall Street securities lawyer who lives in Raleigh, NC, and Andy Glockner, a veteran sportswriter who has worked for ESPN.com and SI.com.

The Cauldron was open for freelance submissions, with a focus on athlete-written posts. In its early days, the site scored hit posts from Steph Curry (on private coaching), Le Veon Bell (on his mother), and Chris Kluwe (on the Gamergate controversy). Many credit the site with establishing a Players  Tribune model (the website owned by Derek Jeter, where big-name athletes often make big announcements), five months before The Players  Tribune came along.

The Cauldron built enough credibility that in September 2015, it announced a digital partnership with Sports Illustrated. The Cauldron left Medium and moved over to SI s web platform, where it was hosted at an SI.com/cauldron URL.

Time Inc. (TIME), the parent company of SI, Time, Fortune, and other legacy print magazines, makes partnerships with third-party digital outlets all the time, but they vary greatly in how extensive they are. A spokesperson says its partnership with The Cauldron was never very extensive. Time Inc. has made far more comprehensive partnerships with Fox Sports Digital, and with FanSided, which it bought outright.

Time Inc. never bought The Cauldron, and never invested in it. The digital pact was based on mutual traffic benefit: more original content for SI via The Cauldron, and more attention for The Cauldron, thanks to having a seal of approval from a top name in sports media.

Three months into the partnership, employees at The Cauldron grew frustrated with Time Inc. s technology, multiple people from the site say. They felt that The Cauldron s content had looked crisper and cleaner on mobile when it was hosted at Medium, and that it looked janky on the SI platform. So in December 2015, The Cauldron returned to Medium, which had just rolled out a new option that allowed partners to remain hosted on Medium but use an external URL.

That meant The Cauldron could return to Medium but keep its partnership with Time Inc intact. The Cauldron kept the SI.com/cauldron web address, and its site read,  Presented by Sports Illustrated.  SI typically chose one story from The Cauldron each day to promote on its SI.com homepage.

At its peak, The Cauldron was posting around 100 original stories per month and garnering 2 to 3 million monthly unique visitors, all under the label of an SI partner site.

In early 2016, shortly after The Cauldron had returned to being hosted on Medium, Jamie O Grady got a heads-up call from someone at Medium to alert him (apologetically, he recalls) that the former ESPN personality Bill Simmons was bringing a new sports site to Medium.

 I was really devastated to hear that,  says O Grady. He knew that the Simmons-led site, The Ringer, would attract a lot of attention at launch, and figured it would become the top sports blog hosted at Medium, likely cutting into his own site s traffic. So he began reaching out to potential investors, framing The Cauldron as a challenger to The Ringer and to The Players  Tribune, which was now in full swing.

O Grady had already met with top digital brass from SI and Time Inc. in the summer of 2015 seeking investment. Time Inc. did not invest, but encouraged him to seek investment elsewhere. O Grady says that Time Inc. repeatedly indicated it would be open to investing at some point or deepening the content partnership. (The Cauldron was initially incubated and seeded by Medium, and later self-funded by O Grady; it didn t have any outside investors.)

O Grady embarked on a slew of pitch meetings with media companies, seeking partnerships, investments or a full sale. His pitch: The Cauldron would continue to post original stories, but ramp up posts by athletes, and ramp up original video with athletes, and create an athlete-hosted podcast network; it would take on The Ringer and The Players  Tribune.

He met in person with CBS, BuzzFeed, Uninterrupted (LeBron James  production company, which has $16 million in funding from Time Warner), and others. He had calls with Bleacher Report, Huffington Post, Vox, Sporting News and others.

He also met with VC firms, including Red Seat Ventures, launched by former execs from Glenn Beck s digital network TheBlaze, and CourtsideVC, an early-stage investor in sports tech platforms like sneaker site StockX. At Courtside, he met with Vasu Kulkarni, founder of a sports video analytics startup called Krossover.

Kulkarni, known to be a mover and shaker in sports tech, introduced O Grady to a man named James Yoder, founder and CEO of a Silicon Valley sports media startup called Chat Sports.

Kulkarni confirms that both The Cauldron and Chat Sports had pitched CourtsideVC, and that Courtside did not invest in either one, and that he connected O Grady to Yoder. Kulkarni vigorously emphasizes that apart from introducing the two men, he played no part in their interactions afterward.

That was a pattern in the reporting of this story: none of the nearly dozen different investors Yahoo Finance interviewed (including Chat Sports investors as well as outside investors that took a meeting with O Grady or Yoder) wanted to be named or quoted by name. They wanted nothing to do with this story. Once you ve heard what unfolded, it s clear why.

Chat Sports offers to buy The Cauldron

After being introduced through Kulkarni, Yoder and O Grady had a series of phone calls about what The Cauldron and Chat Sports might be able to do together.

Yoder, a former product manager at Verizon, launched Chat Sports in 2012. The site began mainly as an aggregator, with a desktop site and mobile app that personalized a feed for users based on their favorite teams, plus original posts written by contributor writers. The app looks a lot like Bleacher Report s popular TeamStream app.

 We wanted to index the Internet, create a Reddit for sports,  Yoder tells Yahoo Finance. More recently, Chat Sports has shifted its focus to Facebook Live videos, in which writers conduct mock drafts and discuss trades.  We are without question the market leader in Facebook Live,  Yoder says.  We produce the highest-quality videos. 

(Last week, Chat Sports published a blog post claiming it reached a total audience of 100 million people in January, partly fueled by  the sports industry s foremost Facebook Live studio.  It would be an astonishing number for a Facebook page that has 138,000 followers.)

Chat Sports also holds recurring live panels under the name Minds Behind the Game; past speakers have included Cleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert and San Francisco 49ers owner Jed York. The last Minds Behind the Game event was last August.

In June 2016, Yoder flew to Raleigh to meet O Grady. And in July, Yoder offered to acquire The Cauldron for $1.8 million.

The purchase would be contingent on Chat Sports raising a Series A investment round by pitching the combined entity. (O Grady says he thought that he would be closely involved in the fundraising process, but quickly found that Yoder did not include him in the effort.)

Chat Sports and The Cauldron, together, would  build the preeminent sports media company in the world,  Yoder wrote to O Grady. Both men tell Yahoo Finance they were, at first, thrilled about the deal.

Yoder sent O Grady an LOI (letter of intent) that stipulated Yoder and Chat Sports would pay O Grady $20,000 upfront, regardless of whether the acquisition went through, and an additional $30,000 breakup fee if it collapsed. The parties agreed.

In a pitch deck Yoder created, he presented the combined team of The Cauldron and Chat Sports, complete with photos and bios of the top executives. He included O Grady as well as boardmembers John Cantarella, a former Time Inc. executive now at Facebook, and Mike Levy, founder of CBS Sportsline. (Cantarella and Levy both declined to speak to Yahoo Finance; Yoder says Cantarella is no longer a Chat Sports boardmember, but still  has a strong relationship with the company. )

 We are raising a $5 million Series A to grow this sports media power,  one slide read.  The funds would be used to expand The Cauldron team, grow our video team, begin direct sales efforts, and accelerate user acquisition. 

A fake email, a fake term sheet

In the late summer and early fall, communication between O Grady and Yoder crumbled. For nearly three months, O Grady says, Yoder was purportedly taking pitch meetings with firms, but was difficult to reach and cagey on the details of his meetings.

(Two separate sports media founders tell strikingly similar stories:

Tim Livingston of TheLead says James Yoder and Chat Sports made a  very generous  offer to buy TheLead one year ago, but then Yoder  became a ghost and I never heard from him.  Months later, Yoder got back in touch and said he now wanted to buy both TheLead and The Cauldron. Livingston had a phone call with O Grady and liked him, but came away thinking that the two were competitors and couldn t coexist. Livingston moved on.

DJ Gallo, founder of the sports comedy site Sports Pickle, also got a job offer from Yoder to join  the Chat Sports-The Cauldron powerhouse  [in Yoder s words in the offer letter] in a senior role, at a base salary of $125,000. O Grady had recommended Gallo to Yoder. Gallo spent a weekend in Raleigh with O Grady discussing the job. But the talks stalled, Gallo says, because Yoder  was very cagey and it was always very hard to get ahold of him. He would say,  I have 10 minutes to talk, from 11:45 pm to midnight.  It was odd. )

Yoder tells the story differently than O Grady. He says that while he was taking meetings with potential investors, O Grady surreptitiously contacted many of them afterward to see if they might want to invest in The Cauldron, separately from Chat Sports. O Grady vigorously denies this, and Yoder declines to give any example of any firm that O Grady interfered with.

Yoder adds that from August through October, as he took pitch meetings,  There didn t seem to be any noticeable interest in The Cauldron. They had a small user base, and what they did have was only thanks to Time Inc. It wasn t really moving the needle for us. 

Nevertheless, on Nov. 9, 2016, Yoder emailed O Grady with what looked like good news: Chinese investment firm WI Harper, Yoder wrote, committed to invest $2 million in Chat Sports as lead investor in a new $5 million Series A round, with the other investors still to be named. Months prior, Yoder had met with WI Harper (he confirms), which has offices in San Francisco and has invested in TV-maker Vizio, photo app Shots, dating app Coffee Meets Bagel, and others.

In that email, Yoder attached an executed term sheet (a document outlining the terms of an agreement to invest) from WI Harper; it was signed by Yoder and by Lee Chang, a partner at Harper. The term sheet did not name The Cauldron or O Grady. Yahoo Finance has seen the term sheet.

Yoder also cc d on that email three partners at an investment firm in Los Angeles led by a renowned sports agent. O Grady had met with this firm in early 2016 as he pitched around The Cauldron, and he had walked away with the sense that the firm was willing to participate in a Cauldron funding round, but not as lead investor. O Grady later advised Yoder to keep that firm in the loop if and when Yoder succeeded in landing a lead investor for the round.

A partner at that firm confirms a meeting took place with O Grady at the beginning of 2016, and says they  had a good chat,  but never made an offer. The firm did not want to be named, and the partner says the firm never had any intention of investing in The Cauldron. But Yahoo Finance has seen communications that strongly suggest otherwise, in which the same partner mentions a  possible acqui-hire  scenario for O Grady and The Cauldron in May 2016. In other words, it appears the firm was quite close to investing in The Cauldron before the situation devolved after The Cauldron linked up with Chat Sports.

Receiving the WI Harper term sheet renewed O Grady s faith in the acquisition. And in December, O Grady received an email from a lawyer claiming to represent Chat Sports. The email asked O Grady for documentation on the structure of The Cauldron, now that the $1.8 million acquisition would be moving forward. The email was signed by Phillip Closius and sent from closiuslegal@gmail.com. (Yahoo Finance has seen the email.)

O Grady was pleased, and replied to the sender with additional logistical questions, and asked to set up a phone call. He did not get a reply for 48 hours. He did an online search and found that Closius is an attorney at the Baltimore firm Silverman, Thompson, Slutkin & White, and also a professor at University of Baltimore s law school. Closius does not list closiuslegal@gmail.com as his email address on his web site, and web searches for the address yield no results.

O Grady sent an email to Closius s professional email address at the Baltimore law firm, referencing the email he had received from the Closius gmail address. A few hours later, O Grady received a voicemail from Closius in which Closius said,  I m just calling to tell you I have no idea what you re talking about in this email about closing docs, so I m sure you have the wrong person, please deal with it.  (Yahoo Finance has heard the voicemail.) O Grady was alarmed. He reached Closius by phone and asked Closius if he knew James Yoder. He says that Closius told him yes, and that Yoder is a family friend, but that he does not represent Yoder.

Next, O Grady responded to the email from closiuslegal@gmail.com and added Yoder, telling Yoder he had reached Closius by phone, and demanding that Yoder explain. Yoder responded to both O Grady and Closius and asked,  Why are you speaking on the phone?!? What the actual F is going on here. 

Yahoo Finance reached Closius by phone. The moment he heard the name Chat Sports, he said,  I don t really do that much with those guys at all  and hung up.

Because his suspicions had been raised from his interaction with Closius, O Grady contacted the offices of WI Harper. He reached the partner whose name was signed on the term sheet, Lee Chang, whom O Grady says had never heard of O Grady or The Cauldron. Chang did recall meeting with Yoder, but said WI Harper turned Yoder down. (WI Harper did not reply to multiple interview requests and calls.)

O Grady sent Chang the WI Harper term sheet he had received. Chang responded to O Grady by email:  I can hereby confirm that this term sheet is indeed fraudulent and that the signature has been forged in my name on behalf of WI Harper Group  We appear to have both been victimized by this intentional act of defraudment.  (Yahoo Finance has seen the email.)

Chang also wrote in his email to O Grady that WI Harper would be sending a cease-and-desist letter to Chat Sports. But after a phone call with Yoder (in which Yoder says he told them his side of things), Harper also sent a cease-and-desist to O Grady, asking him not to disseminate the fake term sheet.

Explaining faked communications

Yoder blames both the fake Closius email and the fake WI Harper term sheet on O Grady.

He confirms that Closius is a friend; Closius s son is Yoder s best friend. Yoder says Closius was representing Chat Sports on its acquisition of The Cauldron, but never had reason to talk to O Grady, which is why Closius did not know O Grady when O Grady contacted him.

As for why someone claiming to be Phillip Closius emailed O Grady from a suspicious gmail account, Yoder initially told Yahoo Finance that he believed O Grady created the closiuslegal gmail account and emailed himself from it.  Our assumption is he created a fake email to act like our lawyer tried to get in touch with him,  Yoder says. As evidence, Yoder says that at some point in their discussions, O Grady raised the idea of putting some of the money involved in the deal in escrow.  I had never heard the word escrow in my entire life,  Yoder says.  And that word is in the email that fake Closius sent to O Grady, and I find it very interesting and convenient that the term that Jamie brought up is in that email. 

But O Grady says he never heard of Phillip Closius before receiving the email from closiuslegal@gmail.com, and that Yoder had never mentioned the name to him.  Why would I send myself an email from a man I had never heard of? 

And on a follow-up call, Yoder revised his answer. When asked again about the fake Closius email, he responded,  I have a prepared statement for this,  and read aloud:  We are very sorry that Jamie O Grady felt misled, but we were doing our best to make a Series A happen and we regret it couldn t happen. 

As for the term sheet, Yoder says O Grady downloaded, without permission, a  draft  of a term sheet from a Chat Sports Dropbox folder and edited it, and that it was this version, fraudulently edited by O Grady, that got sent around. On a call with Yahoo Finance, Yoder initially said he believed O Grady sent around the term sheet himself from Yoder s email address.

But on a follow-up call, Yoder revised his answer. He now says that he, Yoder, did send the email, but didn t know the document he attached, a draft of a term sheet, had been fraudulently edited by O Grady. Yoder says that he had received an email from a Chinese email address claiming to be a representative for a different firm Chat Sports was talking with (Yoder declined to name it), and claiming that this other firm wanted to make its investment through WI Harper. Yoder believes this Chinese contact was actually O Grady assuming a fake identity.

 I don t know why Jamie targeted WI Harper,  Yoder says.  The only thing we could come up with is that he saw us as a mark steal our investor contacts, steal our existing investors, pitch them, trash us, get access to our models and strategy.  Yoder says O Grady did something similar to at least four other firms, but Yoder declines to name them.

As proof of his story, Yoder forwarded Yahoo Finance a follow-up email he sent to the partners at the LA firm that had been cc d on his original term sheet email, alerting them that the term sheet they had been sent was fraudulent. Yoder s point: as soon as he realized that O Grady had fabricated a term sheet and sent it to this firm, he emailed to alert them.

But that email from Yoder to the LA firm was sent on Jan. 17 six days after O Grady had already gotten in touch with the firm to tell them his side of the story. A partner at that firm now says,  I would be very surprised if Jamie was fabricating all this. He struck me as extremely forthright. On balance, I would say Jamie is much, much more credible. 

O Grady acknowledges he downloaded documents from the Dropbox, but says he downloaded them from a link Yoder sent him, and says he was never told not to access the folder. He adds,  How would I know who Lee Chang at WI Harper is, how would I know to fraudulently sign Lee Chang s name to it? 

To recap: All parties confirm that someone sent around a fraudulent WI Harper term sheet; that is not in dispute. All parties confirm that a fake email was sent by someone posing as Phillip Closius; that s also not in dispute.

Sending a false term sheet over email, legal experts say, could constitute wire fraud, a felony that carries up to 20 years in prison. Sending an email posing as someone else could constitute aggravated identity theft, which is also a felony.

Yoder says that Jamie O Grady is a  master of creating fake emails. 

As a demonstration, Yoder sent me, at my work email address, a fake email that made it look like I had emailed Yoder asking for help finding clean urine. Yoder stressed that he faked an email from me strictly to show me what O Grady does.

After I privately forwarded the email to my editors, Yoder emailed me again asking why his email had been opened multiple times; he had tracked the email.  We track every email we send,  he says.  We use an email tracking service. 

Once O Grady heard back from WI Harper, O Grady went into full alarm mode. O Grady s attorney sent Yoder a demand letter asking for the remaining $6,600 of the $20,000 fee O Grady was promised in the original LOI   he received that $6,600 the next day; Yoder had already wired it.

O Grady s demand letter sought an additional $180,000 in damages suffered to The Cauldron.  We arrived at that number,  O Grady said,  because the deal on the table was $1.8 million, but I clearly wasted five months, I ve skipped other avenues of investment, so let s call it 10 percent. 

Yoder countered with a demand letter of his own, in which the language was almost exactly the same as the text of O Grady s letter, but Yoder s demand letter sought $10 million in damages. He says that s because O Grady sent Facebook around 100 takedown requests that forced Chat Sports to remove Facebook videos in which it had embedded The Cauldron s logo. Yahoo Finance has seen both demand letters.

More questions about Chat Sports

In its early days, Chat Sports posted original content from many different writers some of those bylines, like Rick Steele or Tipp Smith, have Twitter accounts that have tweeted only one time. Were they fake? Yoder says yes.  Absolutely we had fake writers,  he says.  That s because we re a scrappy company. What do you have when you start a company? You have zero traffic, you have zero name brand  So we had a writer program for college-aged kids  and sometimes they had information about things that they didn t really feel comfortable writing in their own names. Some people think that s such a terrible thing  journalistic integrity!  that s called growth hacking. 

Yoder says Chat Sports no longer runs fake bylines because it no longer needs to.  I wouldn t do it at an established company,  he says,  but if I started another company  sure, absolutely, if we thought that it was beneficial. I think the founders of Airbnb, the founders of YouTube would say the same thing. 

And during the months in which Yoder met with VC firms, Yoder told O Grady he had met with representatives for NBA star Stephen Curry, and that he was very close to getting Curry to invest in Chat Sports. (Yahoo Finance has seen those communications.) Yoder reiterates to Yahoo Finance,  I know Steph s inner circle well.  But Curry s agent Jeff Austin and Curry s financial manager Frank Zecca both say they have never heard of James Yoder or Chat Sports.

If Yoder did fake an email from his best friend s father Phillip Closius, and forged a term sheet from WI Harper, what was his endgame?

A writer closely associated with The Cauldron, who did not wish to be quoted by name, offers a theory:  He was out of options. He hadn t gotten investment, he had Jamie [O Grady] breathing down his neck, so he thought if he made it look like he got a bite, he d buy himself some time. I don t know what James is capable of at this point. 

Yoder laughs it all off:   Oh, Chat Sports, who s been in business for 4-plus years, and has 30-plus investors, they re making up term sheets.  Why? Why would we do that? 

For what it s worth, Yahoo Finance spoke with five different individuals who are private investors in Chat Sports, which Yoder says has raised $3 million to date. None of them are career investors; most are personal friends of Yoder. All spoke highly of Yoder and said they trust him, but none was willing to be quoted by name. They all work at large corporations and were concerned about potential negative reaction from their employers.

Sports Illustrated dumps The Cauldron

In late January, just days after everything between The Cauldron and Chat Sports fell apart, O Grady received word from Sports Illustrated that they wanted to have a call. On that call, SI and Time Inc. executives told O Grady that Time Inc. would be cutting ties with The Cauldron immediately.

The timing was suspicious to O Grady, though he acknowledges that the partnership with SI had not been going anywhere for either party. Time Inc. demanded that The Cauldron remove all of Sports Illustrated s marks and logos within 24 hours. But the phone call was not hostile.

A spokesperson for Time Inc. tells Yahoo Finance,  We routinely review all of our digital relationships, and as part of that process we decided to end the limiting licensing agreement we had with The Cauldron. 

But multiple sources at Time Inc. tell Yahoo Finance that the decision was prompted by an email that James Yoder sent around.

Chat Sports was also a digital partner of Time Inc., and it remains one at press time. Time Inc. announced the deal in September 2015, though a Time Inc. source tells Yahoo Finance that the partnership with Chat Sports is even smaller than the one with The Cauldron was.

According to Time Inc. sources who described the email, Yoder sent the email to a large list of Time Inc. executives and people in Time Inc. s legal department, alerting them that The Cauldron was using its relationship with SI as a weapon and threatening a hit piece about Chat Sports that would run on SI.com. Yoder confirms he sent an email to people at Time Inc.

Once the email from Yoder came, Time Inc. brass apparently decided that since the relationship had waned anyway, it should cut all ties with The Cauldron rather than investigate the situation further.  Did Yoder act as the catalyst? Yes,  says a Time Inc. source.  But we were never going to fund The Cauldron anyway. 

Regardless of what Time Inc. s true attitude was toward its ongoing relationship with The Cauldron, if Yoder s email played any role in its decision to end the partnership (and sources say it did), then it would appear Time Inc. took Yoder s claims at face value, and perhaps let the wrong partner go.

Sorting through the rubble

What are we left with?

Jamie O Grady says he made a huge mistake getting into business with someone who proved untrustworthy; he points to a paper trail of documents, emails, text messages and Slack messages (all of which Yahoo Finance has seen) that he believes make it very clear he is the victim of a Stephen Glass-like fraud.  I don t need to spin this,  he says.  The facts are what they are. I did nothing wrong. 

James Yoder, for his part, says that everything dishonest was perpetrated by O Grady out of spite that the deal fell through.

Each man now says they are considering suing the other (and each claims tortious interference), though no lawsuits have been filed.

But this story is bigger than The Cauldron and Chat Sports, their two founders, Sports Illustrated, Time Inc., Medium, and even those mega sports stars. It s a simple reminder that no matter how digital the business world becomes, there is still nothing more important than properly vetting a partner.

UPDATE, Feb. 24: Sports Illustrated and Time Inc have ended their partnership with Chat Sports.

SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Reminds Shareholders with Losses on ... NEW YORK, Feb. 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Pomerantz LLP announces that a class action lawsuit has been filed against Yahoo Inc. ( Yahoo  or the  Company ) (NASDAQ:YHOO) and certain of its officers. The class action, filed in United States District Court, Northern District of California, and docketed under 17-cv-00373, is on behalf of a class consisting of all persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Yahoo securities between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016, both dates inclusive (the  Class Period ), seeking to recover compensable damages caused by defendants  violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



If you are a shareholder who purchased Yahoo securities during the Class Period, you have until March 27, 2017 to ask the Court to appoint you as Lead Plaintiff for the class. A copy of the Complaint can be obtained at www.pomerantzlaw.com. To discuss this action, contact Robert S. Willoughby at rswilloughby@pomlaw.com or 888.476.6529 (or 888.4-POMLAW), toll free, ext. 9980. Those who inquire by e-mail are encouraged to include their mailing address, telephone number, and number of shares purchased.

[Click here to join this class action]

Yahoo, together with its subsidiaries, is a multinational technology company that provides a variety of internet services, including, inter alia, a web portal, search engine, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, advertising, and fantasy sports. As of February 2016, Yahoo had an estimated 1 billion monthly active users, roughly 280 million Yahoo! Mail users, and 205 million monthly unique visitors to its sites and services.

The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Yahoo failed to encrypt its users  personal information and/or failed to encrypt its users  personal data with an up-to-date and secure encryption scheme; (ii) consequently, sensitive personal account information from more than 1 billion users was vulnerable to theft; (iii) a data breach resulting in the theft of personal user data would foreseeably cause a significant drop in user engagement with Yahoo s websites and services; and (iv) as a result, Yahoo s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed that hackers had stolen information in late 2014 on more than 500 million accounts. Following the breach, Yahoo executives advised investors that the breach was not material, in part because the Company had not required to reset their passwords. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell $1.35, or 3.06%, to close at $42.80 on September 23, 2016.

On December 14, 2016, post-market, Yahoo announced that it had uncovered a data breach, stating that data from more than 1 billion user accounts was compromised in August 2013. Following Yahoo s announcement, several news sources reported that Verizon was considering ways to amend the terms of its deal with Yahoo to reflect the impact of the data breach and would likely seek  major concessions  from Yahoo. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell $2.50, or 6.11%, to close at $38.41 on December 15, 2016.

The Pomerantz Firm, with offices in New York, Chicago, Florida, and Los Angeles, is acknowledged as one of the premier firms in the areas of corporate, securities, and antitrust class litigation. Founded by the late Abraham L. Pomerantz, known as the dean of the class action bar, the Pomerantz Firm pioneered the field of securities class actions. Today, more than 80 years later, the Pomerantz Firm continues in the tradition he established, fighting for the rights of the victims of securities fraud, breaches of fiduciary duty, and corporate misconduct. The Firm has recovered numerous multimillion-dollar damages awards on behalf of class members. See www.pomerantzlaw.com

CONTACT: Robert S. Willoughby Pomerantz LLP rswilloughby@pomlaw.com Senators Question Yahoo's Candor on Data Breach Two influential U.S. senators rebuked Yahoo Inc. Chief Executive Marissa Mayer on Friday for her company's failure to answer questions about its massive data breaches and for abruptly canceling a recent meeting with congressional staffers.

Continue Reading Below

In a letter addressed to Ms. Mayer, Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Sen. Jerry Moran (R., Kan.) said Yahoo's "last-minute" cancellation of the Jan. 31 meeting "has prompted concerns about the company's willingness to deal with Congress with complete candor about these recent events." Mr. Moran is chairman of the Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Public Safety, Insurance, and Data Security.

"Despite several inquiries by Committee staff seeking information of about the security of Yahoo! user accounts, company officials have thus far been unable to provide answers to many basic questions," the senators wrote.

A Yahoo spokeswoman said late Friday in an email that the company was reviewing the letter and would "respond as appropriate."

Yahoo's two data breaches are believed to be the largest ever reported. In 2013, hackers gained access to private information stored in more than 1 billion Yahoo accounts, an incident the company publicly disclosed this past December. A separate incident in 2014, which Yahoo disclosed last September, incident affected 500 million accounts.

Yahoo has said that it became aware of the 2014 attack later that year, but it hasn't explained why it took two years to disclose the incident to the public.

Continue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT

The company said it learned of the 2013 incident late last year.

The Wall Street Journal reported in January that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into whether Yahoo should have reported the two breaches sooner to investors. Yahoo at the time didn't comment.

In a November securities filing, it said it was "cooperating with federal, state and foreign" agencies seeking information on the 2014 breach, including the SEC.

The breaches also have cast a cloud over Verizon Inc.'s $4.8 billion deal to acquire Yahoo's core business, a deal announced in July before the breaches were disclosed. Yahoo said last month that the deal's closure, which had been expected in the first three months of 2017, would be pushed into the second quarter.

The senators' letter said Yahoo in September discussed the 2014 incident with Commerce Committee staffers and the company said it would provide more details later as new information became available. The letter said when Yahoo contacted the committee in December to report the 2013 breach, the company agreed to provide a follow-up briefing for staff, but then on Jan. 28 canceled the scheduled meeting.

The letter lists five questions for Yahoo and gives the company a deadline of Feb. 23 to respond.

Company Profile:

Yahoo! Inc. is a global Internet communications, commerce and media company that offers a comprehensive branded network of services. As one of the first online navigational guides to the World Wide Web, Yahoo! is one of the leading guides in terms of traffic, advertising, and household and business user reach. The company also provides online business and enterprise services designed to enhance the productivity and Web presence of Yahoo! s clients. No More Ambiguity, Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) And Its Chart Is Now Crystal Clear The technicals for Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has spoken via its technical chart and the message is loud and clear. Based on that message, this is the relevant information necessary to make sense of that current setup. Making successful trades call for a mix of skills. One of those very important skills is the ability to read the technical charts and extract a premise or reason for executing a trade. It follows then, that every trader should make it analyzing the technical charts of a given stock a top priority. Failure to do this could severely hamper success.

(YHOO) is now solidly presented where a clearly defined trend is concerned. This is evident based on information displayed via its 50 and 200 SMAs. The trend levels paint a telling picture which when analyzed, is best characterized as bullish. As a result of the current trends presented by both SMAs, traders have offered a defined and strong outlook for the stock. The overall sentiment or disposition towards the stock can best be described as positive. The discernable sentiment towards the stock has created a resulting influx of opinion that is now created a volume situation clearly titling towards a weak disposition as the situational flux between buyers and sellers take a definitive shape. How much more can we see from this ongoing trend from the sentiment so far? The answer is very telling and hints at what is possible as the sentiments gain strength. ; Since these sentiments have taken shape, a marked level of indifference has materialized when all statistical factors are considered regarding the stock s profile among traders. Overall viability is therefore, based on the foregoing readings, highlighting the disposition of traders towards the stock. This disposition should retain consistency with the overall technical picture cast by the two important technical indicators mentioned above.

Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures offer another dimension to the whole methodology of analyzing a stock for its potential and existing trends. Both measures are relied upon heavily by successful traders, and combined; they offer an insightful peek inside the workings of a stock. They specifically allow traders to gauge whether or not a given stock is overbought or oversold. The overbought/undersold measure should never be underestimated for it allows a trader to see where the directional bearings are for a given stock. Are buyers more represented? Are sellers dominating? Both these indicators help I determining this general direction of the marketplace. YHOO s prevailing reading for its 14-day RSI is 59.41%; this means, on current reading, that the stock is neutral, suggesting that the stock is relatively stable in terms of potential price directional movement in either direction. The stochastic reading offers a supplementary outlook for directional movement of YHOO. Stochastic readings amassed over the last thirty days have created a score of 61.44%. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought or oversold at current levels.

In addition to the outlined leading indicators, a trader can create a more detailed picture of a stock by incorporating the aid of other indicators, particularly the ones geared towards performance. A picture is by now surely emerging on the directional thrust of (YHOO); that emerging picture is proving to be a magnet for traders that have previously shown an interest. The +0.91 has manifested a positive reading in the last month or so of trading since it began its initial directional move. Longer-term, the stock has outperform the S&P 500 by 14.77%. This has created higher daily volatility when matched with stocks of the same class. Things look the same when measured historically. Historical volatility provides a measure of 12.15%. YHOO therefore offers a handy picture of overall momentum based on the foregoing measures. The last, but certainly not least, indicator that helps paint the overall picture of viability is the average true range which is currently 1.43. Combined, all the indicators when synchronized properly can yield excellent trading results.

The market muses have spoken and YHOO has helped them, via its indicators, to showcase what it has to offer at current trading levels. Traders should take heed. Right time to invest?   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), eBay Inc. (EBAY) Shares of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) are on a recovery track as they have regained 34.52% since bottoming out at $35.05 on Mar. 29, 2016. Thanks to a rise of almost 1.75% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 20.43% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -1.31% from $47.19 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 21, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 28.22% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s shares projecting a $47.63 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.67%, and the sector s average is 4.67%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -2.61% since hitting a peak level of $34.43 on Mar. 01, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -2.19% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 12.93% so far on the year   still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 50.36% higher from $22.3, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Jun. 27, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 5.87% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $33.53, EBAY has a chance to add $1.06 or 3.16% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($34.59) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.5 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.27 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, eBay Inc. s EPS growth has been nearly 21%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 7.32%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. eBay Inc. s ROE is 85.13%, while industry s is 17.56%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 10.23%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. EBAY s ROA is 35.02%, while industry s average is 10.16%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 8.14. Yahoo!

Deal Between Verizon And Yahoo Delayed Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) has pushed back the expected closing date for its purchase of Yahoo Inc. s (NASDAQ:YHOO) main business. Verizon cited  work required to meet closing conditions  as the reason for the delayed timetable. The transaction had been expected to close in the first three months of 2017. Now, it is believed that the transaction will close sometime during the second quarter.

Yahoo has been the subject of two huge data breaches since the transaction was announced, causing Verizon to take another look at the deal. Yahoo disclosed the theft of personal data of more than 500 million user accounts in September. The breach was believed to have occurred during 2014. The stolen data included names, email addresses, dates of birth, telephone numbers and encrypted passwords.

A different massive data breach that occurred in 2013 was revealed in mid-December. That breach compromised the private information of more than 1 billion user accounts. Verizon was close to an agreement with Yahoo on how to handling future hacking liabilities when the second, larger hack was revealed. After the second disclosure, concerns rose among investors that the deal was at risk of falling apart. The deal was expected to be worth about $4.8 billion.

Yahoo said it has been continuing to work with Verizon on integration planning. Yahoo said in a statement that it is  working expeditiously to close the transaction as soon as practicable.

Will Yahoo! (YHOO) Beat Estimates this Earnings Season? Yahoo! Inc. YHOO, the troubled Internet company, is expected to beat expectations when it reports fourth quarter fiscal 2016 results on Jan 23.

Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet Services industry. It has gained 46.04% compared with the industry's gain of 15.36%.

Why a Likely Positive Surprise?

Our proven model shows that Yahoo is likely to beat estimates this quarter. A stock needs to have both a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) for this to happen. Yahoo has the right combination of two key components.

Zacks ESP: Yahoo currently has an Earnings ESP of +7.14%. This is because the Most Accurate estimate stands at 15 cents, while the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 14 cents. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.

Zacks Rank: Yahoo currently carries a Zacks Rank #3, which when combined with an ESP of +7.14% make us reasonably confident of a positive surprise.

We caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell-rated) going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions.

What is Driving the Better-Than-Expected Results?

Yahoo reported decent third quarter results with earnings exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate and revenues missing the same by a slight margin. The results showed signs of a business revamp.

Yahoo is in the process of selling its core assets to Verizon for $4.83 billion. Despite the speculation of a billion dollar discount in the purchase agreement between the parties in the wake of the data breach disclosures, Verizon has not changed any terms of the transaction.

The purchase of Yahoo s core assets is in line with Verizon s long-term view to gain traction in the lucrative mobile advertising segment. If the deal materializes, it will improve Yahoo s cost structure.

Moreover, Yahoo guided well for the fourth quarter. Revenues are expected to be in a range of $1.360-1.400 billion, TAC revenues are likely to be $480 million and revenues on an ex-TAC basis are projected to be $880-920 million. Management expects adjusted EBITDA to be in a range of $260 to $300 million and non-GAAP income from operations to be in a range of $140 to $180 million. Avaya Inc. Files for Chapter 11 Protection NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - January 19, 2017) - Avaya Inc. (together with certain of its domestic subsidiaries, collectively, the "Company") today announced that it has commenced a formal proceeding to restructure its balance sheet to better position itself for the future. To facilitate this restructuring, the Company filed voluntary petitions under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the "Court"). The Company's foreign affiliates are not included in the filing and will continue normal operations.

The Company has obtained a committed $725 million debtor-in-possession ("DIP") financing facility underwritten by Citibank. Subject to Court approval, this DIP financing, combined with the Company's cash from operations, is expected to provide sufficient liquidity during the chapter 11 cases to support its continuing business operations and minimize disruption.

"We have conducted an extensive review of alternatives to address Avaya's capital structure, and we believe pursuing a restructuring through chapter 11 is the best path forward at this time," said Kevin Kennedy, Chief Executive Officer of Avaya. "Reducing the Company's current debt through the chapter 11 process will best position all of Avaya's businesses for future success."

As part of Avaya's comprehensive assessment of options to address its capital structure, the Company evaluated expressions of interest in various Avaya assets, including its Contact Center business. After extensive evaluation in consultation with its financial and legal advisors, the Avaya Board of Directors has determined that focusing on the Company's debt structure is paramount and a sale of the Contact Center business at this time would not maximize value for Avaya's customers and all of its stakeholders. Avaya remains in ongoing negotiations to monetize certain other assets, as appropriate, to maximize value for all stakeholders.

"This is a critical step in our ongoing transformation to a successful software and services business. Avaya's current capital structure is over 10 years old and was put in place to support our business model as a hardware-focused company, which has evolved significantly since that time. Now, as a result of the terms of Avaya's debt obligations and the upcoming debt maturities, we need to recapitalize the Company," continued Mr. Kennedy. "Our business is performing well, and we are confident that we can emerge from this process stronger than ever, as this path is a reflection of our debt structure, not the strength of our operations or business model. Pursuing restructuring through chapter 11 will enable us to reduce Avaya's debt and interest expense, while providing increased financial flexibility to further invest in innovation and growth to enhance our market-leading competitive position. Most importantly, we are keenly focused on minimizing disruption to our customers, partners, and employees and do not expect to experience any material disruptions during the chapter 11 cases."

Contemporaneously with the filing of the voluntary petitions, the Company filed a number of "first-day" motions with the Court to facilitate a smooth transition into chapter 11 and minimize business disruption. Among other things, the motions request authorization to continue certain customer and partner programs, and to honor certain employee compensation and benefit obligations.

( NASDAQ : DRYS ) (the "Company" or "DryShips"), a diversified owner of ocean group cargo vessels, announced today that its Board of Directors (the "Board") has determined to effect a 1-for-8 reverse stock split of the Company's common shares. At the Company's annual general meeting of shareholders on October 26, 2016, the Company's shareholders approved the reverse stock split and granted the Board, or a duly constituted committee thereof, the authority to determine the exact split ratio and proceed with the reverse stock split.

The reverse stock split will take effect, and the Company's common stock will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as of the opening of trading on January 23, 2017 under the existing trading symbol "DRYS". The new CUSIP number for the common stock following the reverse stock split is Y2109Q408.

Effecting the reverse stock split will reduce the number of issued common shares from 69,357,841 shares to approximately 8.7 million shares.

No fractional shares will be issued in connection with the reverse split of the issued common stock. Shareholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of the Company's common stock will receive a cash payment in lieu thereof at a price equal to that fraction to which the shareholder would otherwise be entitled multiplied by the closing price of the Company's common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market on January 20, 2017.

Shareholders with shares held in book-entry form or through a bank, broker, or other nominee are not required to take any action and will see the impact of the reverse stock split reflected in their accounts on or after January 23, 2017.

Yahoo! (YHOO) Up 3.6% Since Earnings Report: Can It Continue? It has been about a month since the last earnings report for Yahoo! Inc. YHOO. Shares have added about 3.6% in that time frame, underperforming the market.

Will the recent positive trend continue leading up to the stock s next earnings release, or is it due for a pullback? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.

Yahoo Beats on Earnings in Q4, Delays Verizon Deal

Yahoo! Inc. s fourth-quarter 2016 earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on higher revenues. Shares moved slightly higher as investors are actually looking forward to the sale of the company rather than its earnings.

Over the last one year, the stock has outperformed the Zacks Internet Services industry. It gained 42.38% compared with the industry s gain of 12.78%.



The results were driven by continuous strong performance in mobile and native businesses. Two consecutive quarters of earnings beat show signs of a business revamp at a good time since Yahoo is on the verge of selling its core assets to Verizon.



Marissa Mayer stated that the integration plan is on track and the company will remain deeply responsible for protecting users  information and enhancing security.



Yahoo had given an update on the time of completion of the deal. The deal was expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2017 but now the company has extended it to the second quarter.

Display revenues (ex-TAC) grew 20.3% sequentially and 4.7% from the comparable quarter of 2015. The number of ads sold increased 4% from the year-ago quarter with price per ad (PPA) decreasing 10%.



Mavens (mobile, video, native, social) grew 12.6% sequentially and 25% from the year-ago quarter.



Mobile growth is extremely important because of the increasing use of mobile devices to connect to the Internet. Traffic-driven mobile revenues amounted to $495 million in the fourth quarter.



Other (fees, listings and leads) revenues were up 3.3% sequentially but down 8.8% from year-ago quarter.



Search, Display, and Other platforms represented 35%, 52% and 13% of Yahoo s fourth-quarter ex-TAC revenues, respectively.



By geography: Yahoo generated around 77.9% of revenues on an ex-TAC basis from the Americas (up 12.6% sequentially but down 3.4% from Dec 2015), around 7.4% came from the EMEA region (up 25.7% sequentially but down 8.3% year over year) and 14.7% from the Asia/Pacific (up 2.9% sequentially but down 7.7% year over year).



Margins



Yahoo generated gross margin of 47.5% in the fourth quarter, up 140 basis points (bps) sequentially but down 635 bps year over year.



The company generated operating margin of 4.4% that was better than the previous quarter s -4%.

HPQ released its first-quarter fiscal 2017 earnings yesterday, after its split from Hewlett-Packard Company. The company reported better-than-expected results for the first quarter, wherein both its top and bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Following the results, shares of the company went up more than 2% in after-hours trading yesterday.

The company reported non-GAAP earnings per share of 38 cents per share, which came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Also, earnings increased from the year-ago figure of 36 cents per share.

Notably, Hewlett-Packard Company split itself into two standalone companies   HP Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise HPE   effective Nov 1, 2015. Post the split, its PC and printer business has been operating as HP Inc., while Hewlett-Packard Enterprise specializes in commercial tech products.

The stock has gained approximately 50.28% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized Computer-Mini Computers industry s return of 41.27%.

Quarter in Detail

HP s total revenue increased 3.6% year over year to $12.684 billion and came ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.774 billion. The better-than-expected top-line performance was driven mainly by strength in the Personal System segment and outperformance of newly launched products.

The Personal Systems segment garnered revenues of $8.224 billion compared with $7.476 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. Commercial revenues increased 7%, while Consumer revenues increased 15%. The company witnessed an 8% rise in total shipments mainly driven by a 12% increase in Notebook unit shipment, while Desktops unit shipments were flat on a year-over-year basis.

As expected, Printing revenues were down 3% year over year to $4.483 billion, primarily due to a 3% plunge in supplies revenues. HP s total hardware unit sales increased 6% primarily due to an increase of 2% in Commercial hardware units and a 7% increase in Consumer hardware units.

Non-GAAP gross margin was down 100 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 18.7% primarily due to higher cost of sales. Total adjusted operating expenses decreased 1.8% year over year to $1.345 billion. Non-GAAP operating margin from continuing operations contracted 40 bps to 7.1% mainly due to unfavorable foreign currency impact and higher marketing spending expenses for demand generation.

HP s non-GAAP net income from continuing operations came in at $655 million or 38 cents per share, compared with $645 million or 36 cents per share reported a year ago.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow

HP ended the fiscal first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $6.331 billion compared with $6.288 billion in the previous quarter. The company had long-term debt of $6.688 billion, compared with $6.758 billion last quarter.

The company generated cash flow of $767 million from operational activities during the quarter. During the same period, the company repurchased 25.5 million shares and paid dividends worth $227 million.

Guidance

For fiscal second quarter, HP projects non-GAAP earnings in a range of 37 cents to 40 cents per share (mid-point: 38.5 cents). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 39 cents.

HP reiterated the fiscal 2017 earnings guidance. The company continues to anticipate non-GAAP earnings per share in a band of $1.55 $1.65 (mid-point: $1.6). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.60 per share.

Citigroup announced it has executed agreements that will accelerate the transformation of the U.S. mortgage business by effectively exiting servicing operations by the end of 2018 to intensify focus on originations. The strategic action is intended to simplify CitiMortgage s operations, reduce expenses, and improve returns on capital.

Citi has signed a definitive agreement to sell its mortgage servicing rights, and the related servicing, on approximately 780,000 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loans of non-Citibank retail customers with outstanding balances of approximately $97 billion to New Residential Mortgage LLC (NRZ). The sale, subject to the approval of both agencies and the FHFA, is expected to be completed in the first half of 2017.

In addition, Citi has entered into a subservicing agreement with Cenlar FSB for the remaining Citi-owned loans and certain other mortgage servicing rights not sold to NRZ. Loan servicing on these assets are expected to be transferred to Cenlar beginning in 2018. As part of its assumption of the servicing obligations, Cenlar will provide core operations, customer service and default operations. Loans of Citi s retail banking clients will be retained by Citi but will be included in the subservicing contract.

 Over the past several years, we have made significant progress transforming our business to deliver a sustainable annuity of growth,  said CD Davies, President and CEO of CitiMortgage.  CitiMortgage remains a critical part of serving our customers, deepening relationships with existing and prospective retail bank clients and driving growth in our core markets. We will continue to originate loans for current and new clients. 

Citi will work to ensure a smooth transition in the servicing of these loans for affected clients and is working to transfer as many employees as possible along with the mortgage servicing rights and operations.

These transactions are expected to negatively impact pre-tax results by approximately $400 million, including a loss on sale and certain related transaction costs, in the first quarter of 2017. Excluding these items, these transactions are expected to have a minimal impact on operating revenues in 2017, with expense benefits beginning to accrue in 2018 as servicing is transferred to Cenlar and fully realized in 2019.

(OTC PINK: HMPQ) is pleased to announce its first foray into the Cannabinoids (CBD's) oil extraction business. A Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 transaction with an institutional investor valued at approximately $265,000 allowed HempAmericana to acquire an extraction system from Infinity Supercritical LLC.

Speculation builds on a Verizon-Charter tie-up, no offer made The Verizon logo is seen on one of their retail stores in San Diego, California, U.S. April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo

By Anjali Athavaley and Liana B. Baker

(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc is interested in exploring a combination with U.S. cable company Charter Communication Inc as part of a long list of acquisition targets, but no proposal has been made for a tie-up between the two companies, sources told Reuters on Thursday.

Speculation over a combination of the companies underscores the pressure the nation's largest wireless carrier faces to do a deal in the wake of AT&T Inc's planned $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner Inc. Verizon and other carriers also face a saturated smartphone market.

Verizon said in July that it struck a deal to buy Yahoo Inc's core internet properties, but the deal was cast into doubt after Yahoo disclosed data breaches last year.

"I think the market is predictably impatient and wants Verizon to do something yesterday," said Craig Moffett, an analyst at MoffettNathanson. "The market inevitably draws the comparison to AT&T that, for better or worse, has made its big strategic bet."

After rising as much as 10 percent and hitting a session high of $341.50 on the news, Charter shares eased and were trading up 6.5 percent at $330.59. Verizon shares were down 1.4 percent at $49.08.

Charter and Verizon declined to comment.

A Charter acquisition would signal that Verizon has a drastically different strategic vision than rival AT&T, which has sought to diversify away from the wireless business through its deal for Time Warner and earlier acquisition of satellite-TV provider DirecTV.

Instead, a deal for Charter would indicate Verizon is betting on infrastructure. On its earnings conference call with investors on Tuesday, Chief Financial Officer Matt Ellis said that 5G wireless technology was a focus for Verizon.

"The great irony could be that the cable operators are better positioned to compete in 5G wireless than the wireless operators themselves," Moffett said.

Speculation over a tie-up with Charter has been building steadily since last month when Verizon Chief Executive Officer Lowell McAdam told Wall Street analysts that such a deal would make "industrial sense," according to a December note by BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk.

With Charter, Verizon would gain a fiber and cable network across 49 million homes, including markets in California, Texas, and Florida, that the wireless carrier recently divested to Frontier Communications Corp, JPMorgan analysts said in a note in December.

From a traditional antitrust point of view, the combination of a phone company and a cable company would not raise competition issues that cannot be overcome, said George Bittlingmayer, a professor at the University of Kansas School of Business.

"The wildcard here is whether people's unhappiness with their cable and mobile phone providers would translate into some grandstanding and arm-twisting on the part of the new administration for political benefit," he said.

Phil Cusick, an analyst at JPMorgan, said in an email on Thursday that he expects $2 billion in annual synergies from a Charter deal but added that the deal's math is "difficult to make work," noting that a combined company would be heavily leveraged.

The Wall Street Journal, which first reported a preliminary approach between the companies, said it was unclear if Charter's executives would be open to a transaction and that there was no guarantee a deal would be struck.

Verizon had a market capitalization of $203 billion as of Wednesday's close, while Charter was valued at nearly $84 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Marissa Mayer to leave Yahoo board (Reuters)   Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo Inc. said Monday that it would rename itself Altaba Inc. and chief executive officer Marissa Mayer, a Wausau native, would step down from the board after the closing of its deal with Verizon Communications Inc.

Yahoo has a deal to sell its core internet business, which includes its digital advertising, email and media assets, to Verizon for $4.83 billion.

The terms of that deal could be amended   or the transaction may even be called off   after Yahoo last year disclosed two separate data breaches; one involving some 500 million customer accounts and the second involving over a billion.

Verizon executives have said that while they see a strong strategic fit with Yahoo, they are still investigating the data breaches.

Five other Yahoo directors would also resign after the deal closes, Yahoo said in a regulatory filing on Monday.

The remaining directors will govern Altaba, a holding company whose primary assets will be a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.

The new company also named Eric Brandt chairman of the board, effective Jan. 9. Buzz Stocks: Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc, Yahoo! Inc., and Ascena Retail ...

Verizon Told Conclusion of Yahoo Hack Probe Still Weeks Away Company to decide how to proceed with acquisition at that time

Yahoo! Inc. s investigation into the second major hack of user accounts still has weeks to go, according to a Verizon Communications Inc. executive, who said the company will decide afterward how to proceed with its $4.8 billion acquisition of the tech giant.

 There s a lot of work that has to happen,  Marni Walden, an executive vice president at Verizon, said at an investor conference Thursday.

Yahoo still provides Verizon the scale needed to build its media and advertising business, Walden said. But she cautioned that the company needs to take a damage assessment before making a final decision.

 We have to be responsible to the business and to everyone that invests in Verizon,  she said.

Verizon began exploring a lower price or a possible exit from its purchase agreement in the wake of Yahoo s December disclosure of one of the largest-scale data breaches reported to date, Bloomberg reported at the time.

The Sunnyvale, California-based company said that cyber-thieves in 2013 siphoned information from more than 1 billion Yahoo accounts, including users  e-mail addresses, scrambled account passwords and dates of birth, data that allow criminals to go after more sensitive personal information elsewhere online. It was the second disclosure of a major data breach since Verizon agreed to buy Yahoo. In September, the tech company revealed that more than 500 million users  data had been hacked in a separate, state-sponsored attack in 2014.

Verizon has said it has received only limited information about the incidents and is waiting for a full disclosure when the investigation concludes.

Verizon s position on the Yahoo transaction hasn t changed since the hacking revelations in December, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology.

Verizon has kept its legal team separate from the integration-planning team headed up by AOL Chief Executive Officer Tim Armstrong, said the person. The company wants to ensure it s paying a fair price for the assets without taking on more costs related to the hacks, and is negotiating a separation agreement from any future legal fallout from the breaches. Verizon is seeking to have Yahoo assume any lasting responsibility for the hack damage, the person said.

Yahoo said it s confident in the company s value and continues to work toward integration with New York-based Verizon. Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO)'s New Name Atlaba Will Reflect Its Value based on ... Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) s New Name Atlaba Will Reflect Its Value based on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA)

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) filed a proxy statement in connection with the pending divestment of its core business to Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ). According to it, the company would function as an investment firm once the sale is consummated.

The company indicated that it would reduce its board to just five people from the current eleven directors. That meant Yahoo CEO, Marissa Mayer, and co-founder, David Filo, would not likely to continue as directors, according to S&P Capital IQ analyst Kessler.

The analyst noted that Eric Brandt would replace Maynard Webb as the chairman. Once the transaction is closed, the new name would Atlaba reflecting the value that mostly be based on its 15 percent stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE:BABA).

The analyst did not want to change the rating and reiterated Buy rating on Yahoo shares. Currently, the analyst has a target price of $48.00 on the stock. Mundo Media Going Public Through Harmony Merger Corp. (NASDAQ:HRMN) With ... Mundo Media is going public.

On Monday, Harmony Merger Corp.(NASDAQ:HRMN) announced that it had entered into a plan of reorganization with Mundo Media. The reorganization will see the latter combine into the former, and the two entities trade as one on NASDAQ under the (for now) ticker HRMN. This maneuver offers Mundo a quick and easy public listing by March. Harmony has picked up a couple of percentage points on the announcement, but for all intents and purposes, markets have pretty much ignored the move. This could be an opportunity to get in at the early stages of what could be one of the most promising newly-public entities this year.

Before we get into why, it is worth noting that Harmony is a shell for the purposes of taking other companies public, and will change its name to New Mundo. The operational aspect of the new entity will be purely a ramped up continuation of Mundo s current business.

And what is that? Mundo helps brands with data-driven customer acquisition and monetization. For those outside of the industry, this general business description may seem a little bit jargony, but it s not all that complicated. Through a cloud platform called Mundotrack, it connects advertisers with potential customers online. It does this, much like other advertising networks, though a media network of about 35,000 publishers.

It works like this. A client comes to Mundo and outlines its goals. Mundo feeds these goals to its publisher network, and the network gets to work producing promotional content (native advertising articles, reviews, that sort of thing) and publishing it at a variety of outlets across the internet. Internet users come across, and read, this content, and are redirected towards the advertiser s website. All of this is tracked via the cloud based platform. The captured users then transact with the advertiser, which is again a tracked process.

The ability to track the progress of a campaign is key to Mundo s offerings, as it affords the advertiser an opportunity to accurately calculate its return on investment for ad spend with the campaigns it runs through Mundo s system. Ad-tech companies like Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook Inc (NASDAQ:FB) offer their own versions of the tracking system incorporated into Mundo s offerings, but there s a key difference between Mundo and others, and it s rooted in promotional concept.

Advertisers wishing to promote via Facebook or Google are generally restricted to text-based advertisements located in the sidebar or a sponsored listing section of the various platforms, an Adsense banner, or any other method than looks foreign to the website itself . There is mounting data that suggests native advertising   that is, promotion through things like articles and more complex media content designed to match the look and feel of the website on which it is being displayed   is far more effective than traditional text based or banner style advertising. In order to successfully implement a campaign that uses native advertising, a large publishing network is required. Mundo has that network. Further, it is generally difficult to track with any accuracy the progress of a campaign spread across a large number of publishing outlets. It is possible, sure, but time-consuming and costly. Mundo s platform overcomes this issue, allowing advertisers to stay on top of a campaign s metrics without the time and cost traditionally associated with content network tracking.

The growth of the company speaks for itself. Established in June 2009, Mundo now has 102 employees, and 16,000 campaigns under its belt. During 2016, the company logged more than 85 million conversions, in 182 countries, and across 35,000 unique supply partners. Every month, its content receives 4 billion interactions, and advertisers acquire 17 million users with the Mundotrack platform.

Financials are excellent as well.

Revenues during 2014 came in at $85.6 million, growing to $105.8 million during 2015. 2016 projected revenues come in at $113.1 million (FY financials are yet to be released). Net income 2014 and 2015 hit $4.9 million and $8.8 million respectively, and is expected to reach $11.6 million during 2016. Net income targets for 2017 and 2018 are $15.3 million and $21.5 million respectively.

Looking specifically at the transaction, upon consummation, the current shareholders of Mundo will receive $111.5 million of new company shares, $25 million in cash, and an additional $28.5 million in new company stock spread across the next 24 months based on a predefined net income and stock price targets. The net income targets are as outlined above. The stock price targets are $12 per share at the end of 2017, and $15 per share at the end of 2018.

The names attached to the deal are quite big in the advertising industry. Joel Greenblatt, renowned US hedge fund manager and value investor, serves as Harmony s Special Advisor. Eric Rosenfeld, retired hedge fund manager and senior lecturer at both MIT and Yale, serves as Chairman and CEO of Harmony. Ross Levinsohn will take up the position of Executive Chairman of the company from his current position as non-Executive Chairman. Levinsohn of course is the ex interim CEO of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO), and was for a long time billed as being the number one candidate for taking the helm at Yahoo! on the departure of Melissa Myers. With his position at Mundo now secure, this obviously isn t going to happen, and Mundo should derive great benefit from having his experience and network associated with its operations.

With Mundo s current executive staff and growth rate, the company may open itself up for acquisition before the decade is out.

Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. If Verizon closes its deal - Yahoo could become Altaba Inc and CEO Marissa ... A new SEC document has revealed that when Verizon makes its purchase of Yahoo Inc, certain stipulations are in place that will see the company's name change to Altaba Inc. and the current CEO, Marissa Mayer will resign along with other current executives. This is all of course only if Verizon chooses to close the deal and purchase Yahoo.

While at one time it was the "go to" website for Internet searches, Yahoo has since become a muddled mess of a company. Last year, rumors began spreading that some were interested in purchasing the search giant, with Verizon ultimately becoming the purchaser for nearly $5 billion.

Unfortunately, a few months after the purchase, Yahoo made a data breach public, which Verizon was only privy to a couple days ahead of the public notice. It goes without saying that Verizon didn't take the incident lightly, requesting that $1 billion be knocked off the price as they might abandon the purchase. Things would get even worse for Yahoo as it would disclose yet another data breach, straining the deal with Verizon even further.

Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP Reminds Yahoo! Inc. Shareholders of ... RADNOR, Pa., Feb. 03, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP announces that a shareholder class action lawsuit has been filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) ( Yahoo  or the  Company ) on behalf of purchasers of the Company s securities between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016, inclusive (the  Class Period ).



Deadline Reminder: Investors who purchased Yahoo securities during the Class Period may, no later than March 27, 2017, petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class.

Yahoo is a multinational technology company that provides a variety of internet services including a search engine, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, advertising and fantasy sports. As of February 2016, Yahoo had an estimated 1 billion monthly active users. On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications, Inc. ( Verizon ) formally announced its intent to acquire Yahoo s internet business for $4.8 billion.

The shareholder class action complaint alleges that Yahoo and certain of its executive officers made a series of materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations and prospects to investors during the Class Period. Specifically, the defendants are alleged to have made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Yahoo failed to encrypt its users  personal information and/or failed to encrypt its users  personal data with an up-to-date and secure encryption scheme; (ii) consequently, sensitive personal account information from more than 1 billion users was vulnerable to theft; (iii) a data breach resulting in the theft of personal user data would foreseeably cause a significant drop in user engagement with Yahoo s websites and services; and (iv) as a result, Yahoo s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed that hackers had stolen information in late 2014 on more than 500 million user accounts. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell $1.35 per share, or over 3%, to close on September 23, 2016 at $42.80 per share.

Then, on December 14, 2016, Yahoo announced an additional data breach and reported that data from more than 1 billion user accounts had been compromised in August 2013. Further, Yahoo disclosed that,  [f]or potentially affected accounts, the stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.  Following this disclosure, The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering ways to amend the terms of its deal with Yahoo to reflect the impact of the data breach and would likely seek  major concessions  from Yahoo. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell an additional $2.50 per share, or over 6%, to close on December 15, 2016 at $38.41 per share.

Finally, on January 23, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into the timing of Yahoo s disclosures regarding the data breaches.

Yahoo shareholders may, no later than March 27, 2017, petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

Read More Yahoo! Gives Snapshot of Privacy Law for 2017 Friday, February 3, 2017

Yahoo Inc. s recent cybersecurity woes recall the ever-present danger of  unknown unknowns. 1 Companies that fail to discover or remediate data breaches have traditionally run into a host of legal issues, ranging from contract and tort claims to specific statute or regulatory violations.2 But recent developments indicate that the duty to disclose data breaches after their detection is becoming, perhaps,  duties  to disclose, with nascent issues over the timing and manner of these notifications. Thus, failing to give proper notice of a cyberattack can prove an unexpected source of liability, not only to the putative victims of the breach and state agencies, but also to others, such as the investing public. The recent Yahoo! data breach disclosures are a high-profile example of how a combination of the above can have runaway consequences for large public companies.

By way of background, Yahoo! is currently facing an SEC investigation and is targeted by a variety of class-action lawsuits; it also faces the prospect of termination of an estimated $4.8 billion deal with Verizon over its failure to timely detect and disclose that it had been hacked two years ago (affecting 500 million accounts). Yahoo! reportedly first learned about the initial breach some weeks before alerting the public.3 Proving that things could in fact get worse, Yahoo! more recently reported that an additional one billion user accounts were compromised in a separate cyberattack.4  Biggest data breach in history  is an inauspicious byline for any company, much less one selling its web assets.

Right now, the Yahoo! disclosures provide an extensive case study (and perhaps soon, an SEC  test case ) on best practices in cybersecurity and emerging trends in privacy law:

Yahoo! Disclosures Suggest Greater Cybersecurity Due Diligence in M&A

The timing of the recent Yahoo! hacking revelations has led to intense scrutiny over when exactly Yahoo! learned about its data breaches and why it waited to alert the public. These revelations not only are damaging to its reputation, but also have led Verizon to suggest these breaches and potential fallout could be a  material  change to its $4.8 billion takeover bid.

The immediate takeaway: Yahoo! s cybersecurity troubles should prompt companies to reconsider their cybersecurity evaluations prior to striking a M&A transaction. Companies considering pursuit of a sale should consider safeguards and training in order to preserve their value to prospective purchasers. Likewise, purchasers should investigate the cybersecurity profile of sellers or merger partners, offering extensive questionnaires, hiring IT professionals to conduct objective assessments, employing  white hat  hackers to probe a company s security, among other tools and methods. Reputational harms and damage to goodwill should also not be underestimated many articles discussing the Yahoo! cyberattacks have highlighted the stress and uncertainty caused for many of its users.

Yahoo! Disclosures May Lead to First-in-Kind SEC Case

The SEC is reportedly investigating whether Yahoo! violated securities laws by failing to disclose its cybersecurity risks to investors. In 2011, the SEC released guidance discussing the potential disclosure obligations that could be triggered by a data breach or other cyber risks ( as with other operational and financial risks ) that would impact investment decisions. Notably, the 2011 guidance does not provide a timeline for such disclosures after a breach occurs.

While the SEC has yet to bring any enforcement action related to a failure by an issuer to disclose a data breach to investors, it has been reported5 that former SEC lawyers view the circumstances surrounding Yahoo s disclosures as a better test case than previous investigations. If the SEC ultimately decides to bring a case against Yahoo!, it could provide clarity on the duty to disclose under securities laws, particularly the timing and what properly qualifies as  material information  regarding cyber risks. An enforcement action could also indirectly suggest a federal standard for data breach notifications, at least by public companies. At the moment, efforts to pass federal data breach notification laws have been stalled in Congress, leaving companies to contend with a patchwork of 47 state laws with various disclosure requirements.

Yahoo! Disclosures May Clarify Privacy Harms in Federal and State Courts

Despite ominous headlines, Yahoo! maintains that 90% of its daily active users have  already taken or do not need to take remedial action to protect their accounts.  Yahoo! also apparently did not even lose much traffic or user engagement over its 2016 disclosures.

There is also lingering uncertainty over how Yahoo! users were actually harmed by these intrusions, and whether Yahoo! breached any applicable standards of care the company claims that a state-sponsored actor was responsible for the hacks, suggesting a high-level of sophistication and difficulty in detection.6 These are issues that will be parsed in their ordinary course as blame and costs (if any) are eventually assigned.7

Nonetheless, Yahoo! faces a series of lawsuits in federal and state courts alleging that the company acted with  gross negligence  and harmed users by failing to secure their data. But the plaintiffs will face considerable difficulties in establishing standing in these cases, at least based on existing case law. For data breaches affecting 1.5 billion accounts with countless documents and instances of private information, any potential harm to any given plaintiff might be seen as de minimis or negligible after all, what is the likelihood that any one person would suffer reputational or other damage that would give rise to standing? In perhaps an unintuitive way, the more massive the data breach, the more difficult it could be to establish individual standing to sue for damages, for following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Spokeo v. Robbins (2016), federal courts hold that plaintiffs must allege concrete injuries above and beyond mere technical violations of their statutory privacy rights.

As these cases proceed, it will be of great interest to see how and if plaintiffs establish standing to sue. In the event that Yahoo! users actually document unusual activity in their accounts, such as specific instances of identity theft, their cases should stand a much greater chance of success. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether Yahoo! s delay in informing users could add any weight to these claims or lead to novel theories of harm.

Finally, it should be noted (as a separate matter) that state attorney generals may also initiate actions for civil penalties related to violations of state breach notification laws and they do not face the same standing issues as private plaintiffs.

Conclusion

The ongoing revelations over the recent Yahoo! data breaches should give companies some insight as to how the SEC and FTC may coordinate investigations of security breach notification duties. An FTC enforcement action detailing minimum cybersecurity for large public companies in this context and a similar SEC enforcement action establishing a data breach notification timeline has broad implications for national standards. The related litigation over the Yahoo! data breaches should also help clarify standing requirements and how privacy harms are treated in both federal and state courts.

1. From a speech by then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld,  Reports that say that something hasn t happened are always interesting to me, because as we know, there are known knowns; there are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns; that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns the ones we don't know we don t know. And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones. 

2. This trend should only continue as the FTC grows into the de facto cybersecurity regulator and enforces minimum standards for detection and prevention. The FTC has grown into this role by bringing over 50 cybersecurity-related cases since 2000 (half of which were brought after 2010) under section 5(a) of the FTC Act which allows the FTC to bring actions against  unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.  The FTC has been gradually developing cybersecurity standards under the  unfairness  prong of section 5(a). There is currently a case pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, LabMd, Inc. v. FTC, that could potentially limit the FTC s authority in this regard.

3. There is some conflicting information about when Yahoo! learned about the hacks.

4. This was apparently discovered while Yahoo! was investigating the first breach.

5.  Yahoo Faces SEC Probe Over Data Breaches,  Wall Street Journal (Jan. 23, 2017), https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoo-faces-sec-probe-over-data-breaches-14...

6. Note, however, that this has not been confirmed. There is an ongoing federal investigation into the nature of these cyberattacks and the identity of the responsible actors. Further, some cybersecurity experts, such as Brian Krebs, have questioned Yahoo! s cybersecurity posture in the past. Pretium Resources Inc.: Brucejack Commissioning Accelerated; Forecast to ... VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Feb 3, 2017) - Pretium Resources Inc. (PVG)(PVG) ("Pretivm" or the "Company) is pleased to report the acceleration of commissioning of the Brucejack Mine with dry commissioning now scheduled to commence in March and wet commissioning scheduled to commence in early April.

The capital cost, including working capital, is now estimated to be US$811.1 million, an increase of 16% from the February 2016 capital cost estimate.

Commissioning

Construction has advanced ahead of schedule and dry commissioning of the mill is now planned for March with wet commissioning expected in early April. (Commissioning was previously planned for mid-2017.)

Over 110,000 tonnes of ore has been stockpiled on surface and underground in preparation for mill commissioning. Underground development is well advanced with eleven stopes crosscut on two levels in preparation for long-hole drilling and cross cutting of a further four stopes in progress. Long-hole drills are being mobilized, with long-hole drilling expected to commence the second week of March.

Highlights of Capital Cost Forecast

The total project capital cost forecast (the "February 2017 Forecast") to complete construction of the Brucejack Mine, including contingencies, is US$811.1 million, an increase of 16% from the February 2016 capital cost estimate of US$696.8 million. The February 2017 Forecast includes US$68.8 million of working capital for the first three months of production, but does not take into account any revenue generated during this period.

Key areas of capital cost increases from the February 2016 capital cost estimate include: the transmission line (US$37.9 million); costs to accelerate commissioning (US$13.9 million); new scope items (US$21.7 million); construction overages (US$34.1 million); and Indirects/Owner's costs (US$31.4 million).

The updated capital cost forecast to complete construction of the Brucejack Mine, including contingencies, has been prepared on the basis of: 97% committed of the February 2017 Forecast excluding working capital (US$719.7 million of US$742.3 million), substantial completion of engineering; award of all major contracts and purchase orders; substantial completion of civil works; approximately 95% completion of project wide concrete installation; substantial completion of fabrication of structural steel; approximately 60% completion of erection of site-wide structural steel; approximately 75% completion of process tank installation; approximately 15% completion of mechanical and piping installation for the mill building and associated works; approximately 25% completion of electrical and instrumentation installation for the mill building and associated works, completion and energization of the Stewart to Knipple substation transmission line works; and approximately 90% completion of the Knipple substation to Brucejack Mine transmission line.

Working Capital

With the remaining draw under the US$540 million construction financing and available cash on hand, we have sufficient cash to complete the construction of the Brucejack Mine and are assessing our working capital requirements during the first three months of production.

Project Construction

All major components have been delivered to site and installation and assembly is ongoing. Process tank installation is 75% complete. The shell and heads for the SAG and Ball mills have been installed. Electrical and instrumentation along with other mechanical and piping installation within the mill building is ongoing.

The 330-person camp which includes mine dry, offices, recreation facilities, dining hall and kitchen has been commissioned and is fully operational.

Construction continues on the Valley of the Kings portal building. External structural steel erection is substantially complete. The portal will serve as the primary access point to convey the gold ore from the underground crusher to the mill.

The transmission line construction is nearing completion. As previously reported, all of the towers are in place and the first 42 kilometers of the 57-kilometer transmission line is energized to the Knipple substation. The final 15-kilometer section of the transmission line is 90% complete and expected to be energized this quarter. An additional six 2-megawatt diesel generators are fully commissioned and, combined with our initial 5-megawatts of diesel power, can provide adequate power to maintain full mill and underground production in the event of any grid power interruption.

How Does Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Stack Up Right Now? Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) is an interesting player in the Technology space, with a focus on Internet Information Providers. The stock has been active on the tape, currently trading at $46.59, down from yesterday s close by -0.04%. Given the stock s recent action, it seemed like a good time to take a closer look at the company s recent data.

Fundamental Analysis

This company has been competing with others in the Technology space and offers its own combination of interesting factors Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) currently trades with a market capitalization of $44.56 Billion. That value represents a market adjusting for revenues that have been growing by 15.37 % on a quarterly year/year basis as of the company s last quarterly report.

The balance sheet health of any company plays a key role in its ability to meet its obligations and maintain the faith of its investment base. For YHOO, the company currently has $1.17 Billion of cash on the books. You can get a sense of how sustainable that is by a levered free cash flow of $1.01 Billion over the past twelve months. Generally speaking, earnings are expected to hold steady in coming quarters. Analysts are forecasting earnings of $0.08 on a per share basis this quarter. Perhaps, that suggests something about why 1.76% of the outstanding share supply is held by institutional investors.

Technical Analysis

As most professionals know, technical analysis can offer critical insights into what smart money and insiders think about a stock s prospects going forward. Looking at the stock s movement on the chart, Yahoo! Inc. recorded a 52-week high of $47.00. It is now trading 0.41% off that level. The stock is trading $44.49 its 50-day moving average by -2.1%. The stock carved out a 52-week low down at $33.87.

In recent action, Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has made a move of +3.17% over the past month, which has come on Strong relative transaction volume. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 19.84, and it s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. In terms of the mechanics underlying that movement, traders will want to note that the stock is trading on a float of 6.00% with $883.52 Million sitting short, betting on future declines. That suggests something of the likelihood of a short squeeze in shares of YHOO. Are Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Stock Technicals Favorable? With all other things going on, Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) has been on a run   rising 13.88 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Yahoo! Inc. a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.

Let s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment s value to increase over time. So is with Yahoo! Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $1.41 below YHOO s recent stock price. That s the optimistic view from Wall Street.

The stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 35.91% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.

The company s share price is down -0.88% from previous highs of around $47 per share on March 13, 2017. On the bright side, the company s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 41.47% since hitting lows of $33.93 on March 24, 2016.

Finally, from a technical perspective, there s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $46.26 and $46.43. In terms of pullbacks, $46.83 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Yahoo! Inc. RSI was seen at 66.92. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.

With these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for YHOO is 73.26. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses. )

14-day Williams %R for Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) moved to around 23.43. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought. The Charts Expose On Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Is Causing A Stir The technicals for Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have taken shape, and with them a comprehensive picture has emerged. This is the current state of play as presented by the current technical setup. Hundreds, perhaps thousands of books have been written on trading, strategies, tactics and everything in between. The result has been the mass-proliferation of confusion and less and less attention to the fundamentals of trading success. The fact remains that sound analysis of technical and chart data is still the biggest reason failing traders are transformed into winning traders.

(YHOO) has shown a marked change in trend levels over the course of recent market activity. Based on recent activity surrounding both the 50 and 200 SMAs, there s been a marked trend created which can be described as bullish. The composite picture painted by the trends built around both SMAs has also created a measured analysis of current investor sentiment as the stock navigates upside and downside risk. The established market sentiment toward the stock has created a trading environment which can suitably be described as positive. There has also been a knock-on effect as it relates to trading volume now reflected in weak real-time sentiment on the buying and selling curve; this has created in turn, indifference toward the stock as measured across a broad statistical mix of the general trading community.

As a composite and comprehensive tableau, the stock s position in the minds of the trading market reflects a broad analysis of technicals and inherent trends which underpin overall market-trading viability.

Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures are two very important leading indicators that help traders gauge overall movement of a particular stock; they act as boosters to technical analysis. Together they show in a measured way, whether or not a stock currently overbought or oversold. This indicator is crucial in determining whether traders are tipped toward the side of buying more of the stock, or doing the opposite and selling more of the stock. This is very important directional information necessary for making trading decisions. (YHOO) s current measure for its 14-day RSI is 65.77%; this is suggestive that on balance of the indicator, the stock is neutral   neither overbought nor oversold and therefore not susceptible to any undue price movements in either direction. The stochastic picture presents a complimentary view of overall sentiment in the present state for (YHOO). Stochastic data gathered over the last 30 days has created a score of 77.91%. This indicates that the stock is overbought at current levels.

The successful trader has within her or her arsenal a wide range of tools. The leading indicators mentioned above help make up that arsenal but they are by no means the only ones needed for trading success. Short term indicators, as well as performance indicators, can mean all the difference in executing successful trades. The omens depict a telling picture in terms of the near-term trading setup for (YHOO); this makes things very interesting to the curious and interested eye. The +1.43 has created a positive in the trailing 30 days since initiating movement. Over the extended term, the stock has outperform the S&P 500 by 19.84%. This consistent movement and its attendant overall performance have produced higher daily volatility when compared with other stocks ranking in the same peer group and on the same exchange. The picture looks the same when the stock is assessed against volatility levels measured historically. This historical volatility gives a current reading of 10.15%. These measures of historic volatility are very handy in judging the underlying price momentum and the rate of change in the price of (YHOO). Bound up this picture of volatility, is another measure that gives the underlying thesis for (YHOO). This can best be seen by analyzing the readings for the stock s average true range, currently 1.35. ATR is a fine augment to the other indicators outlined above and should be used in conjunction and not as a standalone. Accused Spy in Yahoo Hack Worked for Russian Tycoon's Bank One of two alleged Russian intelligence officers charged by the U.S. with hacking a half-billion Yahoo! Inc. email accounts worked for billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov s investment bank until last week.

Igor Sushchin left his job as head of security at Renaissance Capital s brokerage unit March 16, a day after the U.S. unsealed its indictment in San Francisco, the company s press service said in a statement Monday.

RenCap said it learned about the case from media reports and wasn t aware of any accusations of wrongdoing in connection with Sushchin s employment, which was first reported by the Kommersant newspaper. Sushchin couldn t be reached via two home numbers listed in a Moscow directory.

The U.S. government accused Sushchin and a second agent of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, of conducting a broad scheme of profit-seeking and intelligence gathering that started no later than January 2014 and continued through at least Dec. 1, 2016.

Sushchin joined Renaissance Broker at the end of 2010, two people familiar with the situation said, declining to be identified as they are not authorized to speak officially.

The U.S. prosecutors outlined a scheme of economic espionage, wire fraud and theft of trade secrets, accusing the two Russian agents of conspiring with a hacker in the 2014 breach of Yahoo. A second hacker, a Kazakh-born Canadian, allegedly targeted people inside Russia in related data-gathering efforts.

Prosecutors said Sushchin was  embedded  at a Russian financial firm, where he monitored employee communications. They said it wasn t clear if the firm, which they didn t identify, knew of his FSB affiliation.

Another FSB officer in the U.S. indictment is Dmitry Dokuchaev, a former hacker that was recruited by Russia s FSB. He, as well as senior FSB cyber investigator Sergei Mikhailov were arrested in December on treason charges and are being held in Moscow s Lefortovo prison, according to Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer involved in the case. They are charged with having contacts with U.S. intelligence, though few details of the case have been made public.

Russian investigators also detained Ruslan Stoyanov, an executive at Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity company. Kaspersky said the case involved allegations of wrongdoing before he worked for the company.

The people familiar with Renaissance Broker said the company started an internal investigation after the U.S. allegations became public.

Prokhorov, who also owns the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, couldn t be reached for comment immediately through his Onexim Group holding company, which declined to comment.

Russian officials have repeatedly denied conducting state-sponsored hacking. Stocks Highlights: Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), United Continental Holdings, Inc. (UAL) Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO):

Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP Announces Shareholder Class Action Lawsuit ... RADNOR, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

The law firm of Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check, LLP announces that a shareholder class action lawsuit has been filed against Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) ( Yahoo  or the  Company ) on behalf of purchasers of the Company s securities between November 12, 2013 and December 14, 2016, inclusive (the  Class Period ).

Yahoo shareholders who purchased their securities during the Class Period may, no later than March 27, 2017, petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class.

Shareholders who wish to discuss this action or request additional information about the lawsuit are encouraged to contact Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check attorneys D. Seamus Kaskela or Adrienne O. Bell at (888) 299-7706 or online at: https://www.ktmc.com/new-cases/yahoo-inc#join.

Yahoo is a multinational technology company that provides a variety of internet services including a search engine, Yahoo! Mail, Yahoo! News, Yahoo! Finance, advertising and fantasy sports. As of February 2016, Yahoo had an estimated 1 billion monthly active users. On July 25, 2016, Verizon Communications, Inc. ( Verizon ) formally announced its intent to acquire Yahoo s internet business for $4.8 billion.

The shareholder class action complaint alleges that Yahoo and certain of its executive officers made a series of materially false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company s business, operations and prospects to investors during the Class Period. Specifically, the defendants are alleged to have made false and misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) Yahoo failed to encrypt its users  personal information and/or failed to encrypt its users  personal data with an up-to-date and secure encryption scheme; (ii) consequently, sensitive personal account information from more than 1 billion users was vulnerable to theft; (iii) a data breach resulting in the theft of personal user data would foreseeably cause a significant drop in user engagement with Yahoo s websites and services; and (iv) as a result, Yahoo s public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times.

On September 22, 2016, Yahoo disclosed that hackers had stolen information in late 2014 on more than 500 user million accounts. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell $1.35 per share, or over 3%, to close on September 23, 2016 at $42.80 per share.

Then, on December 14, 2016, Yahoo announced an additional data breach and reported that data from more than 1 billion user accounts had been compromised in August 2013. Further, Yahoo disclosed that,  [f]or potentially affected accounts, the stolen user account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (using MD5) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.  Following this disclosure, The Wall Street Journal reported that Verizon was considering ways to amend the terms of its deal with Yahoo to reflect the impact of the data breach and would likely seek  major concessions  from Yahoo. On this news, Yahoo s share price fell an additional $2.50 per share, or over 6%, to close on December 15, 2016 at $38.41 per share.

Finally, on January 23, 2017, The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had opened an investigation into the timing of Yahoo s disclosures regarding the data breaches.

Yahoo shareholders may, no later than March 27, 2017, petition the Court to be appointed as a lead plaintiff representative of the class through Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check or other counsel, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. A lead plaintiff is a representative party who acts on behalf of all class members in directing the litigation. In order to be appointed as a lead plaintiff, the Court must determine that the class member s claim is typical of the claims of other class members, and that the class member will adequately represent the class in the action. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision of whether or not to serve as a lead plaintiff.

Password (at least 6 characters required) Watch User Engagement When Twitter Inc (TWTR) Stock Reports Earnings Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR ) is either a buyout target worth at least 20 percent more or is trading at roughly fair value in the $13 billion   $16 billion market cap range. Last year, rumors that Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM ) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) might buy it sent the stock trading at unsustainable levels.

The market has since removed any takeout premium from its stock price. Good fourth-quarter engagement numbers could therefore have a positive influence on the stock price.

Previous Quarter Highlighted TWTR Stock s Growth

CEO Jack Dorsey stressed evidence of accelerating growth with its audience. Introducing new products and encouraging higher audience engagement are two goals for Twitter for this year. And last quarter, it focused on live events.

By delivering on a better user experience, TWTR stock has a good chance of reporting higher engagement numbers. This includes DAU (daily active users), MAU (monthly active users) and time spent on the site. If these numbers are up, advertisers will willingly spend more per click and campaign.

Analysts have low expectations for TWTR revenue and expect sales growth of only 4.2% year-over-year. The average revenue estimate is $740.13 million (the range is $713.4 million   $769.8 million. Yet for the full year, analysts expect sales growing 15% but just 9.3% next year.

Also expect strong user engagement from the live events. TWTR launched the live initiative last September. It syndicated the experience to its partners, including Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO ), AOL, SBNation and Sports Illustrated. Its TV partners, which included Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Microsoft and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), were also channels for Twitter s platform.

Presidential Election Tweets

Twitter s 10.4% jump in the last week may already show the benefit of tweet volume increasing during the U.S. elections. Advertisers likely bid higher rates for exposure on the platform in that time.

That could mean TWTR s revenue beats analyst expectations. Twitter noted that debates will help DAU numbers, but the platform requires constant live content to sustain quarterly active user growth:

 We want to really leverage this nationally and globally recognized content on live to build awareness of underserved so that we do have a dependable place to find live content. So we re very encouraged by those events, but for them to have an impact over a 90-day period our live strategy has to be more fully rolled out. And we re on the process of doing that. 

Next Page Eastern District of Pennsylvania Reaffirms Entry of Summary Judgment in Favor ... USA February 6 2017

On remand from the Third Circuit, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania recently reaffirmed its entry of summary judgment in favor of Yahoo!, holding once again that the company s email-to-text alert system did not qualify as an automatic telephone dialing system ( ATDS ). Specifically, the court found that  present capacity  was the appropriate standard and declined to apply the  potential capacity  test that a narrow majority of the FCC announced in its July 2015 Declaratory Ruling & Order ( 2015 Ruling ). See Dominguez v. Yahoo!, Inc., No. 13-1887, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11346, at *7 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 27, 2017); Rules & Regulations Implementing Tel. Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 30 FCC Rcd. 7961 (2015).

As we previously discussed here and here, plaintiff Bill Dominguez alleged that Yahoo! violated the TCPA by sending him text messages using an email-to-text alert system to which the previous holder of his phone number had subscribed. Throughout the proceedings, Yahoo! consistently argued that it had not violated the TCPA because it had not used an ATDS, as its system  lack[ed] the capacity to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator.  Dominguez, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11346, at *3. The court granted Yahoo! s first motion for summary judgment, agreeing with the company s position and holding that the Plaintiff had failed to offer any evidence that Yahoo! s text alert system  had the capacity to randomly or sequentially generate telephone numbers (as opposed to simply storing telephone numbers).  Id. at *4; Dominguez v. Yahoo!, Inc., 8 F. Supp. 3d 637 (E.D. Pa. 2014). The Plaintiff appealed to the Third Circuit, which, in a non-precedential decision, reversed and remanded with instructions that the trial court provide a fuller explanation of whether Yahoo! s system met the statutory definition of an ATDS and consider the FCC s 2015 Ruling addressing the definition of  capacity.  Dominguez v. Yahoo!, Inc., 629 F. App x 369 (3d Cir. 2015). Critically though, and as Judge Baylson s most recent decision notes,  [t]he Third Circuit agreed with [the EDPA s] definition of  random or sequential  number generation . . . and its holding that the statutory definition does in fact include such a requirement.  Dominguez, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11346, at *4. On remand, Yahoo! renewed its motion for summary judgment and separately moved to exclude the Plaintiff s four expert witnesses who sought to opine upon the system s  potential  capabilities. The court granted both motions.

Following the Third Circuit s direction, the court began by providing a lengthy discussion of the term  capacity  as it has been used and interpreted in relation to the TCPA. Specifically, the court dissected the FCC s various rulings and found that the 2015 Ruling s  potential capacity  standard had  advanced a definition of  capacity  that is at once broader than the definitions previously elucidated by the FCC, and lacking in clearly delineated boundaries.  Id. at *17. Nevertheless, the court considered whether it would be appropriate to retroactively apply the FCC s interpretation to conduct that occurred before its adoption. In doing so, it discussed whether the 2015 Ruling was most akin to a substantive, adjudicative, or interpretive rule or a statement of policy, all of which have different retroactivity implications.

Ultimately, the court concluded that, while  the 2015 Ruling does not have the procedural hallmarks of a  substantive  rule, it certainly has the character of one,  and  [t]o refuse to classify the 2015 Ruling as a  substantive  rule . . . may then be to put form over substance.  Id. at *31-32. As a result, the court found that  retroactive application of the 2015 Ruling would . . . be manifestly unjust to Yahoo,  and that  it should apply the concept of  present capacity  because that was the FCC s test when this case was filed and when Plaintiff was receiving the text messages which form the basis of this lawsuit.  Id. at *19. Consistent with its prior opinion applying this standard, the court found that  the Yahoo system did not qualify [as an ATDS] under the TCPA s requirements.  Id. at *7. In doing so, the court noted that  [t]he Third Circuit affirmed this Court s interpretation of [the] statutory language, which, in the absence of any other evidence, requires granting Yahoo s motion for summary judgment.  Id.

Despite its finding that a  present capacity  test should be applied, the court went on to consider whether the  Plaintiff has provided evidence to create a factual dispute as to whether the Yahoo E-mail SMS Service had the  potential  or  latent  capacity to generate and dial random or sequential numbers.  Id. at *35-36. The court concluded that he had not. Specifically, the court considered the declaration of a Yahoo! employee who testified that  the system was not set up (nor did it have the unused functionality) to send text blasts to multiple numbers  and  was never connected to any server, system, or database that had any capacity to generate phone numbers.  Id. at *36-37. The court also considered the testimony of Plaintiff s four experts, whom Yahoo! moved to exclude under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). The court granted Yahoo! s motion as to all experts, holding that their opinions as to the system s latent capacity were not reliable because they were presented  without testing the viability of [the experts ] hypotheses,  and therefore would not be helpful to a jury asked to assess the capacity of a computer program. Dominguez, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 11346, at *58. The court recognized that, because the system had been abandoned by the time the case was remanded,  it was not possible for anyone to test  it. Id. at *60. But it reasoned that, while  this fact may generate some sympathy for [the] Plaintiff, it does not generate a viable legal theory, which is what the law requires.  Id. at *60-61. As a result, because the Plaintiff s experts  opinions were not based on testable or falsifiable methodologies, the court found them to be inadmissible. And, as these opinions were the only evidence the Plaintiff presented as to the potential capacity of Yahoo! s system, the court concluded  that [the] Plaintiff has not presented enough evidence to warrant a jury finding in its favor  even if the standard found in the 2015 Ruling applied. Id. at *61.

Yet the court still went a step further, addressing whether, even if they were admissible, the experts  reports and testimony  could establish a factual issue that the Yahoo system was able to generate sequential or random numbers and call those numbers.  Id. It held that they could not, as they did not present evidence showing that Yahoo! s system could both generate and call random or sequential numbers, as is required by the text of the statute. See 47 U.S.C.   227(a)(1) ( The term  automatic telephone dialing system  means equipment which has the capacity (A) to store or produce telephone numbers to be called, using a random or sequential number generator; and (B) to dial such numbers. ). As a result,  even if the expert reports were considered reliable and admissible, Yahoo would nevertheless be entitled to summary judgment.  Id. at *67. In short, the court found that, even under a  potential capacity  test, and even if Plaintiff s expert testimony was admissible, Yahoo! was entitled to summary judgment because it had not been shown that it used an ATDS in sending text messages to the Plaintiff.

The court s decision clearly and reasonably adjudicates a case involving an alleged TCPA violation that occurred well before the FCC s 2015 Ruling, while also strongly calling into question the soundness of that Ruling, which is currently on appeal before the D.C. Circuit, and may well be revisited by the FCC itself. We will continue to monitor the status of that appeal and other courts  treatment of these issues to see if they follow Judge Baylson s lead.

The strong results come amid the company s continued push into smartphones, which accounted for more than half of all advertising revenue for the first time in its history. Online shopping through its auction service also helped thanks to tighter cost controls and higher spending by users. Its financial services business, which settles online transactions and provides credit cards, also performed better than analysts expected.

 Almost all businesses such as ads, paid membership, shopping and credit card were well-managed and provided positive surprises,  Naoshi Nema, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, wrote in a Feb. 4 report where he upgraded his outlook.  We were relatively pessimistic on its future potential but we now change our view and believe its sustainable growth. 

Nema upgraded his price target to 660 yen per share from 400 yen, while boosting his outlook to overweight from neutral. Nomura Holdings Inc. also increased its price target to 640 yen from 590 yen.

The company operates one of Japan s most popular websites and provides everything from news aggregation to shopping through its auction platform. Monthly active users grew 16 percent from a year ago to 37.3 million, representing about a third of Japan s population.

Yahoo Japan counts SoftBank Group Corp. as its largest shareholder, with 36.38 percent of outstanding shares, according to Bloomberg data. Sunnyvale, California-based Yahoo! Inc. is the second-largest, with 35.57 percent. Here's the full list of 97 companies that just filed against Trump's ... President Donald Trump s first two weeks in office have been tumultuous, to say the least. The biggest question ahead of the president s inauguration last month was just how literal Trump was on his historical campaign trail. While many who voted against Trump were afraid that the radical ideas he often proposed were in fact an accurate representation of his intentions, many supporters seemed to be operating under the impression that Trump would relax a bit if he did indeed end up taking office. For example, billionaire Trump supporter Peter Thiel famously said that voters should  take Trump seriously but not literally. 

The country and the world have now quickly learned that much of Trump s rhetoric was indeed to be taken literally, and his recent immigration ban is by far the new president s most controversial move to date. Now, in the latest chapter of this saga, 97 companies including some of the biggest names in tech have banded together to file a legal brief in opposition of Trump s executive order on immigration.





Don't Miss: The one way Android will never, ever be able to compete with the iPhone

In an amicus brief filed late on Sunday in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, 97 companies clearly stated their opposition to Trump s controversial executive order, which bars refugees and valid visa holders from seven Muslim countries from entering the United States. A US District judge temporarily lifted the immigration ban late on Friday night, but Trump and his staffers have already stated their intention to fight the judge s decision.

Apple, Google, Facebook, Spotify, Airbnb, Citrix, eBay, Etsy, Intel, Microsoft, Netflix, Snap, Twitter and Uber are just some of the high-profile companies that participated in filing the brief, the goal of which is to make clear that the technology industry and American businesses in general oppose Trump s ban.

 Immigrants make many of the Nation s greatest discoveries, and create some of the country s most innovative and iconic companies,  the brief stated.  America has long recognized the importance of protecting ourselves against those who would do us harm. But it has done so while maintaining our fundamental commitment to welcoming immigrants through increased background checks and other controls on people seeking to enter our country. 

The brief can be seen in its entirety at this link, and the complete list of 97 companies responsible for the filing can be seen below.

Yahoo's email scan draws more questions from European Commission

Yahoo to be named Altaba, Mayer to leave board after Verizon deal Marissa Mayer, President and CEO of Yahoo, participates in a panel discussion at the 2015 Fortune Global Forum in San Francisco, California, U.S. November 3, 2015. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage/File Photo

Yahoo Inc said Monday that it would rename itself Altaba Inc and Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer would step down from the board after the closing of its deal with Verizon Communications Inc.

Yahoo has a deal to sell its core internet business, which includes its digital advertising, email and media assets, to Verizon for $4.83 billion.

The terms of that deal could be amended - or the transaction may even be called off - after Yahoo last year disclosed two separate data breaches; one involving some 500 million customer accounts and the second involving over a billion.

Verizon executives have said that while they see a strong strategic fit with Yahoo, they are still investigating the data breaches.

Five other Yahoo directors would also resign after the deal closes, Yahoo said in a regulatory filing on Monday. (bit.ly/2iXrbwn)

The remaining directors will govern Altaba, a holding company whose primary assets will be a 15 percent stake in Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and 35.5 percent stake in Yahoo Japan.

The new company also named Eric Brandt chairman of the board, effective Jan. 9.

(Reporting by Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; editing by Sriraj Kalluvila, G Crosse) Yahoo And Verizon: Either Way, It's Yahoo Shareholders That Lose By Parke Shall

Debate has continued this week as to whether or not Verizon (NYSE:VZ) will be considering abandoning its planned purchase of Yahoo's (NASDAQ:YHOO) core assets. We think the possibility is still there that Verizon may abandon this deal, but after we stepped back and looked at the whole situation this morning we were really only able to draw one conclusion: the real loser in the Verizon Yahoo deal is Yahoo shareholders.

Yahoo has done an enormous disservice to its shareholders over the last couple of years and is simply not a stock we would want to own going forward, no matter what the outcome of the merger.

From our viewpoint, management and the board have consistently put shareholders last and have displayed actions to us that consistently make us glad that we are not Yahoo shareholders. In today's article, we wanted to discuss two potential outcomes of the Yahoo/Verizon merger and also talk about how both of these outcomes are detrimental to Yahoo shareholders. From there, we want to briefly discuss why we don't think Yahoo's management team should be trusted going forward and why Yahoo should not be a stock to own regardless of how and when the Verizon deal finally hits a terminus.

As for those unfamiliar with the story, Yahoo and Verizon have supposedly been jockeying back-and-forth on terms since it was revealed that there has now been a second data breach that Yahoo recently incurred that it did not share with Verizon prior to Verizon making its bid for the company. We have been questioning the Yahoo and Verizon merger since the revelation of these data breaches for several months now. We also wrote a series of articles skeptical about Yahoo being able to sell its core business at all, claiming that there may have been a couple of wild cards underneath the surface that Yahoo may have not disclosed. We commented in these articles that we found it to be troubling how long it was taking Yahoo to sell its core assets. We were put off by how long the process was taking and how many times the company had repeated itself when it made announcements that it was putting itself up for sale. It seems like a lot of show and not a lot of action.

Lo and behold, several years go by and Yahoo finally finds a bidder. It then comes out of the woodwork that Yahoo has not disclosed two massive data breaches to the bidder, once again highlighting how poorly run Yahoo's business is. This brings us to where we are today, with analysts trying to figure out whether or not the entire process might derail based on these new revelations.

Though it may not be a shocker to our readers, we are going to continue to be skeptical and take the position that this very well may wind up costing Yahoo the merger. To no surprise of ours, analysts have come out and taken the "rose colored glasses" view, recently stating that they do not expect this data breach to terminate the merger, while they do believe that it may be cause for some concessions on the part of Yahoo. Seeking Alpha recently reported,

Despite some widely debated comments from Verizon's Marni Walden, who said at a Citi conference this week that the company was "unsure" about closing a $4.8B deal for Yahoo, analysts are still largely expecting the deal to go through.

"For all of Yahoo's flaws, you're not going to find a property that has a billion users that you are going to pick up for [less than] $5B," says A.T. Kearney's Greg Portell, pointing to ad tech's key to the play. "The deal's economics were good at the start of this. So, if Verizon is able to knock off a billion dollars and get protection against user data exposure, it's better for them."

"There are not a lot of media properties on the planet that have a billion user accounts and leading categories," says CFRA's Scott Kessler, who notes the massive data breach actually proved Yahoo's massive scale.

Verizon could be hard pressed to prove that Yahoo's worth declined due to breaches that occurred a few years ago.

We would take a couple of exceptions with this line of thinking that analysts have put forth. First, it seems as though they are making excuses for Yahoo's poor performance. Where are the analysts holding Yahoo management's feet to the fire? While management might enjoy analysts making excuses for them, we are not sure that shareholders find this amusing. Putting out the fact that Yahoo may wind up losing money on the deal in a cavalier fashion should only irritate and annoy Yahoo shareholders further.

Analysts back up these statements by telling people to look at what an opportunity it is to capture 1 billion users for the price. While we certainly understand the importance of owning user data, and we understand the role that it played in buyouts of companies like LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), we can't help but wonder this: if it is such a great price and Yahoo's user information is such a fantastic commodity, why wasn't there a legitimate and significant bidding war for this information? We know there were deliberations between several companies who considered buying Yahoo, but we think anybody would be hard-pressed to say that it was an all out war for Yahoo's assets. It actually seemed like quite the opposite, that perhaps Yahoo was having trouble selling itself.

The problem is that either way, Yahoo shareholders are getting the worst end of this deal. If the deal doesn't go through, it will have been an enormous waste of resources and time once again exemplifying Yahoo management's inability to get any type of tangible work done. It would not only be a huge disappointment in terms of morale for Yahoo shareholders, it would be a tremendous waste of resources.

If the deal goes through for a lower price, like some of these analysts are suggesting, it is also a negative for Yahoo shareholders. Management will likely retain their bonuses from pushing the merger through, the legal teams that helped out will get their fees and the discount will really come at the expense of Yahoo shareholders.

So forgive us for once again taking the skeptical angle to these continued talks as both parties try to establish what the end game is going to be for this merger. We believe that there is still significant chance that the merger winds up getting called off and to be honest, we still don't know if there are any more skeletons hiding in Yahoo's closet. One thing is for sure and that is this entire debacle has spoken volumes about the incompetency of Yahoo's management and Board of Directors. There is absolutely no way we would be confident in holding Yahoo stock going forward, regardless of the outcome of this deal, with the current management and current board of directors in place.

Inc. s former chief executive, today was appointed executive chairman of digital advertising agency MundoMedia Ltd.

The Toronto-based firm went public through a merger with Harmony Merger Corp., which has headquarters in New York.

 We are extremely excited that Ross is taking a much larger and more impactful roll at Mundo,  Jason Theofilos, chief executive of MundoMedia, said in a statement.

Prior to leading Yahoo, Levinsohn was president of Fox Interactive, a unit of Rupert Murdoch s News Corp. Levinsohn is a board member of Tribune Media, Zefr and and Vubiquity. He graduated from American University.

 The growing importance of precision marketing plays squarely in the favor of MundoMedia s business model," Levinsohn said in a statement.

HP Inc (HPQ) Introduces Multiple Products at CES, Las Vegas Technology giant HP Inc. HPQ ushered in the New Year with the launch of latest ultrabooks, PCs and notebooks at CES 2017. It is an annual technology tradeshow conducted by the Consumer Technology Association every year in January in Las Vegas. The latest additions will provide faster web access, have increased durability and larger displays.

The company s latest offering includes the Spectre 13   the thinnest and most powerful iteration of laptops   that are anticipated to enhance the web experience and provide high-quality visuals. Powered by Intel Inc. s INTC i5 or i7 processors, the ultra-portable gadget is expected to improve user experience through better connectivity.

The ultrabook has huge file storage capacity with solid state drive options and provides 3D graphics. It has been designed to make data center handling simpler, more flexible, efficient and cost effective. Though the ultrabook is a high-end product, it is suitable for both consumer and corporate purposes. HP s Spectre 13 could challenge Apple's AAPL laptop in the rapidly growing market for ultra-portable computers. The new Ultrabook runs on Microsoft Corp. s MSFT Windows 10.

Other Launches at the Event

Notably, the company rolled out five new products last week at CES 2017. The offerings include the HP EliteBook x360, Spectre x360, ENVY Curved All-in-One 34, Sprout Pro and OMEN X 35 Curved Display that has a high-definition (HD) screen which can be easily connected to other devices. The company claims that these products are the world's slimmest full performance notebook PCs, which are likely to offer the ideal combination of enhanced performance, mobility and price.

HP Elite products cater to the current demand for ultra-thin, ultra-light, power efficient mobile products that are suitable for a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) environment. Hence, these products should help the company hold its own in the sluggish PC market.

The slimmest among the Elite family, the models will be available from January. These products will enhance web experience and provide high-quality visuals. Moreover, the new line-up will add variety and functionality to some older notebooks and desktops, which in turn, will attract new clients.

Conclusion

HP s efforts to turn around the business have been commendable. The company has adopted a strategy of engaging in product innovations and differentiation as well as enhancing the printing business  capabilities to stabilize the top line.

Furthermore, looking at the data compiled by two independent research firms   Gartner and International Data Corporation   we believe that the downtrend in PC shipments moderated in third-quarter 2016, compared with the previous quarters.

Notably, for HP, this was the second consecutive quarter of year-over-year shipment growth following five back-to-back quarters of underperformance. The company witnessed a 2.3% increase in PC shipments. We believe that the spin-off from Hewlett-Packard Company and restructuring initiatives, such as focus on product innovations, pricing, marketing and sales activities, divestment of non-core assets, and job cuts to lower costs, are finally paying off.

The stock has gained approximately 40.8% over the last one year, outperforming the Zacks categorized Computer-Mini Computers industry s return of 20.7%. Yahoo Inc board names Eric Brandt as chairman of boards

The Clock Ticks Down to the Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Acquisition I m increasingly confident that Yahoo! Inc. s (NASDAQ: YHOO ) acquisition by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ ) is going to close only a little behind schedule.

Yes, the online superpower is facing an SEC investigation into why management waited years to let the world know their billion-user database had been hacked. But those managers and the compliance systems the regulators want to test are unlikely to stick around once VZ stock takes its prize.

Troubles for YHOO Stock?

The SEC investigation doesn t seem like it will become the kind of juicy probe into fraud that can bring a company to its knees. All the regulators really want to know is whether the timing of the hack announcement left outside investors at a disadvantage.

Based on price action since we all found out that YHOO security was compromised several years ago, I d say the gun just isn t smoking. Management confessed that the database had been accessed back in September, when the stock was trading at a comfortable $44.15. Today, shares are priced around $45, so any investor harm here is minimal at best.

What we re left with is a deal timeline that is pushed back only a few months. Given the complexity of YHOO stock s media architecture, a merger like this takes time to do right, so I m actually pleased to see a few delays.

And they re almost certain to be just delays and not any kind of hard stop. This deal made sense before the investigation, and it still makes sense now.

YHOO s business may have flattened out, but Verizon isn t interested in building a business organically from the ground up. They re already running a $200 billion juggernaut that has stopped growing on its own. Bolting YHOO onto that chassis could help earn VZ stock 4%-5% of top-line growth in the first year after the deal closes. That s enough to keep shareholders happy in the near term.

From there, it s a matter of strategic execution.

VZ stock has ambitious media plans, and I think the ongoing presence of the Huffington Post proves that the company is dedicated to building an empire of online content. Granted, YHOO itself hasn t been growing that fast lately   revenue stalled last quarter   but that s what happens when managers brace for a transition   plans get mothballed, ideas get filed away, and the innovation cycle pauses.

Whether it gets back to work down the road is up to the new managers. In the meantime, it s likely that the processes which facilitated the security breach at Yahoo will go away as the acquisition unfolds.

Verizon has its own account security, and moments like this are a traditional opportunity to let IT managers on both sides take the best overall solution for the larger enterprise and let the weaker systems go.

Between The Numbers: Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) Shares of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) are on a recovery track as they have regained 34.03% since bottoming out at $34.62 on Mar. 28, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.79% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 19.99% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -1.67% from $47.19 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 21, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 31.71% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s shares projecting a $47.63 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 16.64%, and the sector s average is 4.7%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Fifth Third Bancorp (NASDAQ:FITB) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -14.64% since hitting a peak level of $28.97 on Mar. 01, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -9.48% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -8.31% so far on the year   still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 57.39% higher from $16.02, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Apr. 07, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 19.56% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $24.73, FITB has a chance to add $2.72 or 11% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($27.45) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 3 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.32 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Fifth Third Bancorp s EPS growth has been nearly 10.3%. Sure, the percentage is encouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 4.77%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Fifth Third Bancorp s ROE is 10.03%, while industry s is 16.04%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 15.47%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. FITB s ROA is 1.1%, while industry s average is 2.3%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 2.43. Latest Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Rating Reiterated by SunTrust Banks, Inc. Raymond James Trust N.A. reduced its position in shares of Whirlpool Co. (NYSE:WHR) by 0.2% during the first quarter, Holdings Channel reports. The institutional investor owned 16,584 shares of the company s stock after selling 28 shares during the period. Raymond James Trust N.A. s holdings in Whirlpool were worth $2,842,000 at the end of the most recent reporting period. Other hedge funds and other institutional investors also recently made changes to their positions in the company. Global X Management Co. LLC increased its position in shares of Whirlpool by 93.8% in  Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Closed its Previous Trade at $46.4 Share Price and 1 Year Extreme Prices Analysis

The share of Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) currently has a value of $46.4 while the company s 52 week low is at $34.62, the shares dropped to the 52 week low on Mar 28, 2016. While the company s share hit the 52 week high on Mar 21, 2017 stationing the value of $47.19.

The difference of 52 week low value as well as 52 week high value and the current price of the stock suggests the next move of the shares. If the share price is currently hovering near the 52 week low and the value is achieved in the current past then it can suggest that the price of the shares is likely to go up.

Share Volume Analysis

The volume of the particular stock is the shares bought and sold in a single trading day. The average volume of a stock suggests the liquidity of a particular company. If the average volume is low then the liquidity is low which means it is hard to buy or sell the stock as there are fewer buyers or sellers of the stock.

Currently the shares of Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has the trading volume of 6 Million shares with the average trading volume of 6.45 Million shares.

Price to Earnings Ratio

Yahoo: New Data Breach Involved Forged Cookies Yahoo Inc. (YHOO), which has been reeling from two data breaches that impacted more than 1.5 billion customer accounts and has placed its deal with Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) in doubt, disclosed late Wednesday yet another potential hit.

According to a Reuters report, Yahoo has been alerting users of potential malicious activity in their accounts, but this time from 2015 and 2016. The previous data breaches, which were the largest in history, occurred in 2013 and 2014.

In a statement to Reuters, Yahoo confirmed it was alerting users who may have been impacted by the malicious code but would not say how many customers it affected. Yahoo said some of the latest potential incident is the result of a  state sponsored actor  that was behind the 2013 and 2014 data breaches. In those cases the culprits got away with email addresses, dates of birth and security question answers. Yahoo said the malicious activity was centered on  forged cookies.  Yahoo said the forged cookies could enable a hacker to access user accounts without the need for a password.

The Sale to Verizon

The latest revelation comes at a perilous time for Yahoo, which is trying to close the sale of its core internet assets to Verizon. Verizon originally agreed to pay $4.85 for those assets, but the deal has been up in the air since Yahoo disclosed the breaches.

In September, Yahoo rocked investors, consumers and Verizon when it revealed certain user-account information was stolen by the state-sponsored actor. At the time, Yahoo said as many as 500 million user accounts were affected by the hack. The stolen information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and hashed passwords, Yahoo said. (See also: Yahoo Confirms Massive Data Breach.)

That was followed by an announcement in mid-December in which Yahoo said it believes an  unauthorized third party  stole data associated with more than 1 billion user accounts in August 2013. Yahoo thinks the 2013 hack is  likely distinct  from the other incident. In November, Yahoo disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that law enforcement provided it with data files that a hacker claimed was Yahoo user data. Upon analyzing it with the help of outside forensic experts, Yahoo has said it turned out to be the company s data.

Takeda Completes Acquisition of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. CAMBRIDGE, Mass. & OSAKA, Japan--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE:4502) ( Takeda ) today announced the completion of its acquisition of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (ARIA) ( ARIAD ) for $24.00 per share in cash.

 We are very pleased to have completed the acquisition of ARIAD Pharmaceuticals. The addition of ARIAD s innovative targeted therapies and research and development capabilities strengthens and diversifies our oncology business, positioning Takeda for sustainable long-term growth in this priority therapeutic area,  said Christophe Weber, president and chief executive officer of Takeda.  We are particularly excited by the global potential of brigatinib, an investigational drug product, which we believe will become a best-in-class ALK inhibitor for non-small cell lung cancer with the potential to achieve peak annual sales of over $1 billion. We are also impressed with the swiftness and agility of Takeda and ARIAD employees as they have planned for a successful integration while remaining focused on strategic goals. This bodes very well for the future of our combined business, and we look forward to building on this strong start to maximize the benefit of Iclusig  (ponatinib) and potential of brigatinib for cancer patients. 

 The acquisition of ARIAD is transformational for Takeda Oncology. Iclusig enhances our strong position in hematology in the U.S., and brigatinib has the potential to broaden our solid tumor franchise globally,  said Christophe Bianchi, president of Takeda Oncology.  There is a strong cultural fit between our two companies, with a shared mission to advance innovative therapies to improve the lives of patients with cancer. We have been working together over the past month to plan for a smooth integration of our businesses and we will work closely with regulatory authorities on our brigatinib market authorization submissions. 

Takeda continues to expect the transaction to be accretive to Underlying Core Earnings by FY2018. Strong revenue growth and synergy savings will offset increased sales and marketing costs for the anticipated brigatinib launch.

Tender Offer Details

Takeda completed the acquisition through a tender offer and subsequent merger of ARIAD with Kiku Merger Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. ARIAD is now an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda.

The tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of ARIAD common stock expired as scheduled, immediately following the offer s expiration time of 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time, on February 15, 2017. Computershare Trust Company, N.A., the depositary and paying agent for the tender offer, has advised Takeda that 158,558,628 shares of ARIAD common stock were tendered, representing approximately 81.4% of the shares outstanding. All of the conditions to the tender offer having been satisfied, Takeda s indirect wholly owned subsidiary Kiku Merger Co., Inc. has accepted for payment and will promptly pay for all shares tendered. The transaction will be funded by approximately $3.5 billion of new debt and the remainder from existing cash. Takeda is expected to remain investment grade and the transaction has no impact on Takeda s dividend policy.

On February 16, 2017, Takeda completed its acquisition of ARIAD through the merger of Kiku Merger Co., Inc. with ARIAD without a vote of ARIAD s shareholders pursuant to Section 251(h) if the Delaware General Corporation Law. As a result of the merger, ARIAD became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda. In connection with the merger, all ARIAD shares not purchased in the tender offer have been converted into the right to receive $24.00 per share in cash, without interest (less any required withholding taxes), the same amount paid for all shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the tender offer. ARIAD common stock will cease to be traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

Evercore Partners acted as financial advisor and Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton LLP acted as legal advisor to Takeda. J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lazard acted as financial advisors and Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP acted as legal advisor to ARIAD.

Read More Unicorn Buybacks and Securities Law People are worried about unicorns doing stock buybacks.

No, they're not really worried, but I appreciate that Uber Technologies Inc. hasn't waited to go public to start doing stock buybacks from its employees. "Those who work at the San Francisco company for at least four years can sell as much as 10 percent of their shares."

Two themes that I like to talk about around here are:

Private markets are the new public markets, and massive multinational companies with 11-digit valuations can raise billions of dollars from institutional and retail investors without the formality of going public; and so The main function of public markets these days is not for companies to raise money, but for them to return money to shareholders.

Uber is the poster unicorn for the first theme, and I'd thought for the second as well, but perhaps it will become massively profitable and move to capital-return mode without ever going through an initial public offering.

But not yet. Now it is losing money and being subsidized by (billions of dollars from) investors. Which makes the buybacks particularly fascinating:

While Uber s buyback approach can help it retain talent, it may also benefit the company s bottom line. Using its own money, Uber purchases common stock for 25 percent to 35 percent less than the price of preferred shares from its most recent funding round, one person familiar with the matter said. It can then turn around and sell shares at a premium in a subsequent round. Still, an employee who got their stock four years ago stands to make more than a 10-fold increase on the sale.

When I was an investment banker working on structured equity issuance and buybacks, one dorky joke that we had was that companies could do "equity-financed stock buybacks." The idea was that a company would issue new stock, and use the money it raised to buy back stock. This of course makes no sense -- it was a joke -- though it came up more often than you'd think. (Bankers like to propose trades, what can I say.) One reason it makes no sense is that it is pointless for the company: Issuing stock and buying back stock leaves you in the same place as before. Another reason it makes no sense is that it is pointless for investors: If outsiders want to buy stock, and employees want to sell stock, the employees can sell stock to the outsiders, and the company never needs to get involved. In Uber's case, where the stock is not public and there are restrictions on trading, this does not apply; the buyback program fills a real need for employees.

But the deeper economic problem with the equity-financed stock buyback is what you could call the bid-ask spread. When public companies sell stock to the public, they usually need to do it at a discount: If your stock is trading at $100 before the offering, you're going to sell stock at $98 or $95 or whatever. (You're creating new supply, driving down the value; plus you are selling a big block and paying to get liquidity.) And when public companies buy back stock, they usually need to do it at a premium: If your stock is trading at $100 before the buyback, you're going to pay $101 or $102 or whatever in the buyback. (You're reducing supply -- and increasing earnings per share -- which drives up the value; plus you are buying a big block and paying to get liquidity.) So the equity-financed stock buyback -- selling stock at $98 to buy back the same stock at $102 -- is obviously dumb.

With Uber -- with unicorns more generally, perhaps -- it's the opposite. Uber is, as it were, getting paid the bid-ask spread. Uber isn't paying for liquidity on either side of the trade; it's being paid for liquidity. When Uber sells stock to new investors, it can get a premium, because the stock is sexy and scarce and not available on the secondary market. When Uber buys stock from its employees, it does it at a discount, because the employees are desperate for liquidity and can't sell their stock anywhere else. Uber can make a profit just on issuing and buying back its own stock. I kind of don't understand why it would even bother building self-driving cars; it's already built a perpetual motion machine.

Sexual harassment as securities law.

One thing that we talk about around here is that all law is securities law: If a public company does a bad thing, chances are it has also violated the securities laws by failing to disclose that bad thing, and so the Securities and Exchange Commission has a universal jurisdiction to investigate whatever badness it can find. So securities regulators are also antitrust regulators, environmental regulators, gun-control regulators, automobile regulators, conflict-minerals regulators and regulators of political speech. And so of course a bunch of people pointed me to this story yesterday:

Federal prosecutors are investigating whether 21st Century Fox Inc. should have disclosed to investors that it made secret settlement payments to female on-air hosts who alleged sexual harassment. The investigation came to light in New York state court on Wednesday when a lawyer, Judd Burstein, said a client he didn t identify had received a grand-jury subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York. Burstein, who was in court on a case against Fox, said he was later told by prosecutors in Manhattan that the securities unit is investigating  sexual-harassment issues  at the company.

Sexual harassment is not generally a matter for federal securities prosecutors. But the concern here seems to be that Fox entered into secret settlements of sexual-harassment claims against Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly that might have been material to shareholders. That does sort of look like a securities issue. Like, there are contracts, and money, and the disclosure of where the money went might not have been as clear as some investors might like. How did Fox document these payments in its books and records, and in its audited financial statements? It's relatively easy to recast this not as a "sexual-harassment issue" but as an accounting one.

But: What if it wasn't? Imagine that a powerful executive at a public company sexually harassed many women over many years, but didn't reach settlements with them, and just intimidated them to keep quiet. Then one day they all went public (and sued). Is that a securities law issue? I think it might be. The executive's actions -- which exposed the company to the risk of expensive lawsuits and reputational damage -- are material to shareholders, just as material as any settlements would be. If the company didn't disclose those actions -- and it is in my experience rare for public companies to disclose a risk factor like "our CEO is a lech" -- then why wouldn't that be a securities-law violation? The SEC doesn't seem interested in acting as a universal sexual-harassment regulator for public companies, but if it wanted to it probably could.

Elsewhere in SEC jurisdiction: "The new Republican leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission has imposed fresh curbs on the agency s enforcement staff, scaling back their powers to initiate investigations of alleged financial misdeeds."

Congrats Yahoo.

In the back of your mind, didn't you kind of think that the revelations of hacking at Yahoo would lead to a breakup of its deal to sell its core business to Verizon and leave it back at square one? I just felt like in 2022 I'd be reading and writing about how Yahoo needs to either find a strategy for its core business, or find a way to get Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to buy it, or otherwise figure out a way to escape the labyrinth in which it has found itself. But no it's fine, "Verizon Communications Inc. is close to a renegotiated deal for Yahoo! Inc. s internet properties that would reduce the price of the $4.8 billion agreement by about $250 million after the revelation of security breaches at the web company." Yahoo will finally be able to get rid of itself and concentrate on what's left: its massive Alibaba stake, free of the distractions of the internet business. Although wait:

In addition to the discount, Verizon and the entity that remains of Yahoo after the deal, to be renamed Altaba Inc., are expected to share any ongoing legal responsibilities related to the breaches.

Ugh, guys. We've been talking about this forever. What you need is a clean shiny box (Altaba) to hold your Alibaba shares, so they can trade like a proxy on Alibaba, and so Alibaba can eventually buy the box. That was the whole point of selling the core business: to put the Alibaba shares (and, yes, fine, some Yahoo Japan Corp. shares, and some patents) into a clean box, separated from a core internet business that, by some accounts, might be worth less than zero. Now Yahoo is smudging the box. Altaba will get rid of the actual money-making parts of the core business, but will keep the uncertain contingent liabilities. (Though not all of them: "Verizon would give up its right to sue over the idea that Yahoo had covered up the hacks.") "Core Altaba" -- the Altaba remnants of core Yahoo -- will definitely be worth less than nothing. Good job everyone.

Elsewhere in M&A second thoughts: "Anthem Wins Bid to Block Cigna From Dumping $48 Billion Deal."

Chicken Libor!

Here's a Bloomberg Businessweek feature on my favorite recent financial scandal, Chicken Libor. Well, not really. When I talk about Chicken Libor, I mostly mean allegations that poultry producers misrepresented chicken prices when they were surveyed for a widely-used index, thus pushing up the index price. (Like Libor.) But this story is more about broader antitrust concerns in the chicken industry, and focuses on a different survey: "Agri Stats, a private service that gathers data from poultry processors, produces confidential weekly reports, and disseminates them back to companies that pay for subscriptions." As one law professor explains,

information-sharing services in other industries tend to deal in averaged-out aggregated data for example, insurance rates in a given state. Such services run afoul of antitrust law, he says, when they offer projections or provide data so detailed that no competitor would reasonably share it with another. Getting detailed information is a particularly useful form of collusion, Carstensen says, because it allows co-conspirators to make sure they re all following through on the agreement.  This is one of the ways you do it. You make sure that your co-conspirators have the kind of information that gives them confidence so they can trust you, that you re not cheating on them,  he says.  That is what creates stability for a cartel. 

Man, antitrust law is hard. Transparency itself can create antitrust problems; telling your competitors how much you sell and how much you charge, with enough detail and frequency, can allow them to coordinate a cartel. I wonder if there are any lessons for the financial industry, as it moves toward a future of greater transparency and more consolidation.

Correlation.

Here is an article about how "cross-asset correlation recently fell to its lowest level since 2006," even as more money continues to move from active to passive strategies. One obvious takeaway is that money always flows to the strategy that was just successful, not the one that will be soon. Passive investing dominated a world of stability, supportive monetary policy and high correlations; active investing is poised for a comeback "when asset prices can go down as well as up." So of course everyone is rushing into passive.

There are some nuances to that story, though. For one thing, cross-asset correlations don't necessarily tell us much about active versus passive management: Most passive funds, and even most active funds, focus on one asset class. "Passive investing" is, in practice, about actively choosing an asset class, and then trying to buy the whole market for that asset class. If stocks are going to go up while bonds are going to go down, you can make money by buying a stock index fund and selling a bond index fund. And if you instead decide to buy an active bond fund managed by a brilliant manager, it's still going to disappoint you if the whole bond market is heading down.

Also here's a great line:

 In theory, there is a better backdrop now, but obviously those fund managers would still need to pick the right things,  said Andrew Sheets, chief cross-asset strategist at Morgan Stanley.

That is usually the big problem in investing. If all the things are the right things, then it's hard to distinguish yourself. If many of the things are the wrong things, though, it's hard to pick the right ones.

Elsewhere: "Record $13 Billion Pulled From Biggest Public U.S. Hedge Fund Och-Ziff."

Quants.

"Why are so many machine-learning experts writing high-frequency-trading code instead of curing cancer," people ask. Well:

Attention Wall Street: Instagram is looking to hire. Facebook Inc. s photo-sharing app plans to double its engineering staff in New York this year to 150 people. In particular, it is looking for machine-learning experts, many of whom work for hedge funds or investment banks. These  recovering quants  as Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger calls them will allow Instagram to more personally tailor its feed and other features to its 600 million users.

In general, the realistic alternative use for all of Wall Street's wasted talent is not curing cancer; it's optimizing the delivery of advertisements in Silicon Valley.

An arbitrage.

Aaron Brown wrote about "an underappreciated magic to allowing diversity of numeraire" (back when the dollar/euro forward was about $1.40):

Suppose Anne from the United States makes a bet with her Catalan friend Ana s. If in one year it costs more than $1.40 to buy  1.00, Ana s will pay Anne  1.00. Otherwise Anne will pay Ana s $1.40. From Anne's point of view, if she wins, she wins  1.00, which she can sell for more than $1.40. If she loses, she loses $1.40. Ana s uses parallel reasoning. If she wins, she wins $1.40, which she can sell for more than  1.00. If she loses, she pays  1.00. Both women have positive expected values from this bet.

Here is ... maybe the opposite trade?

Gambling site BetMoose allows anonymous players to make wagers on all manner of events from the Oscars to the French presidential election. But one bet in particular has an odd payoff structure: Will Trump ban Bitcoin? An anonymous player,  Protus,  has a wager for both  yes  and  no,  which might normally be a sort of arbitrage.

Except:

He or she is American and the bet is payable in Bitcoin. A  yes  outcome would make it impossible to make good or to get paid. A  no  bet, on the other hand, is all reward with zero risk.

Ah yes, but who is going to take that "no" bet against you, except you? Elsewhere, Kyrgyzstan's central bank wants all of its citizens to own at least 100 grams of gold.

People are worried about unicorns.

Snap seems unworried:

Snap Inc. set the valuation on its initial public offering at between $19.5 billion and $22.2 billion in what could be the third-biggest technology offering of the past decade, people familiar with the matter said. The maker of disappearing-photo application Snapchat is valuing its shares at $14 to $16 on a diluted basis, the people said, asking not to be identified as the details are private. It could be the biggest technology IPO since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. raised a record $25 billion in 2014.

I suppose that betrays a little worry -- previous guesses had gone as high as $25 billion -- but that's still a big IPO. Elsewhere in unicorns, or geese, or goosicorns, Canada Goose Holdings Inc. filed the papers for its IPO.

People are worried about bond market liquidity.

People are worried that it's hard to buy credit-default swaps on weird hybrid European bank debt:

 The credit-default swap market hasn t kept up with the fast-moving changes in bank bonds,  said Louis Gargour, chief investment officer of London-based LNG Capital, an alternative investment-management firm.  That s a problem when you want to hedge a specific part of the capital structure. 

I never quite understand these complaints. Like, if you are buying weird hybrid European bank debt, isn't that sort of necessarily a bet on the credit quality of that particular bank and security? I can see why it would be attractive to have basis arbitraging instruments available, sure, and CDS is helpful for dealing desks, but I don't get why investors would need CDS. If you are worried about the credit, just don't buy the bonds!

SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Pomerantz Law Firm Announces the Filing of a Class Action ...  Down. Set. HUT! Yahoo Teams Up With Pizza Hut to Launch Squares Pick'em for ... SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO), in partnership with Pizza Hut, LLC, today launched Squares Pick em, the first digital game of its kind on Yahoo Sports that lets football fans play along with the Big Game.

"We want to create the best fantasy sports experiences for our users and, working with Pizza Hut, we re making one of the biggest traditions for football fans across the country digital with the new Squares Pick em game," said Lisa Utzschneider, Chief Revenue Officer at Yahoo.

If the square you pick matches the score at the end of the quarter, you win ultimate bragging rights.

Yahoo is offering this new game during the most watched sporting event of the year, and the busiest day of the year for Pizza Hut. From office groups to viewing parties, Yahoo s Squares Pick em game is a fun way to enhance the game watching experience and challenge family, friends and colleagues. Similar to Yahoo Fantasy Football, commissioners in Squares Pick em can set up private leagues and establish settings for their specific league before inviting friends to join.

"The entire sports viewing occasion has changed, with digital engagement being as much a part of it as the game itself, which is why we re excited to be part of the launch for this new digital game from Yahoo Sports," said David Daniels, Vice President of Advertising & Media at Pizza Hut. "Squares Pick'em on Yahoo takes a classic game and makes it even better. Friends and family can now eat Pizza Hut pizza and play Squares Pick em wherever they re watching the game."

In 2016, the Super Bowl was one of the most visited days of the year on Yahoo Sports and fans spend nearly 30 billion minutes a year playing fantasy sports on Yahoo. Pizza Hut set a digital sales record during last year s big game, as fans flocked to the brand s variety of digital ordering options. This year, Pizza Hut will be featured in display, search and email advertising to drive sign ups for the Squares Pick em game on Yahoo Sports. Yahoo will also promote the new game through the blogs Shutdown Corner, RotoArcade and additional NFL editorial.

Verizon shaves $350 million from Yahoo price Yahoo Inc. CEO Marissa Mayer, already under fire on Wall Street for her inability to turn around the company and for the humiliating security lapses that came on her watch, hailed a new sale agreement with Verizon. (Photo: Associated Press)

Verizon Communications Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have agreed to reduce the price the telecommunications giant will pay to acquire the online media company by $350 million.

In July 2016, Verizon agreed to pay $4.8 billion for Yahoo's internet business, which includes Yahoo Mail, Flickr, Tumblr and web properties such as Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports.

Then, in the wake of the deal's announcement, Yahoo disclosed that it had suffered two massive data breaches, one in 2013 and another in 2014, the first one believed to be the largest reported data breach ever, involving the theft of data associated with more than 1 billion user accounts in August 2013.

Verizon Communications Inc. and Yahoo Inc. have amended the terms of a deal in which Verizon will acquire Yahoo. (Photo: Getty Images)

Under the deal's amended terms, Verizon will pay $4.48 billion and the two companies will share some legal and regulatory liabilities arising from the breaches.

After the breaches, Wall Street had some concern over the ultimate consummation of the deal. Last week, Yahoo shares rose 2% on a report that the two companies had renegotiated a new price that was $250 million below the original offer.

Verizon aims to expand and improve its own mobile and online video efforts with Yahoo's advertising platforms and grow its audiences through Yahoo's 1 billion monthly users.

"We have always believed this acquisition makes strategic sense," said Marni Walden, Verizon's executive vice president and president of product innovation and new businesses. "We look forward to moving ahead expeditiously so that we can quickly welcome Yahoo's tremendous talent and assets into our expanding portfolio in the digital advertising space."

The amended agreement, she said, "delivers a clear path to close the transaction in the second quarter."

Under the new terms, Yahoo will be fully responsible for any cash liabilities incurred following the deal's closing arising from shareholder lawsuits and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations related to the breaches. Yahoo will be responsible for 50% of any liabilities related to any third-party litigation and non-SEC government investigations related to the breaches.

The SEC has opened an investigation into whether Yahoo should have informed investors about the breaches sooner, according to a January report in The Wall Street Journal.

This amended deal appears to be a win for Yahoo, which has struggled over the last decade as Facebook and Google achieved dominance in the digital advertising space.

"We continue to be very excited to join forces with Verizon and AOL," said Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in a statement. Mayer, brought in to run Yahoo in 2012, who pushed the company to emphasize mobile, video and social projects, has been unable to turnaround the company's fortunes. Mayer is a native of Wausau.

Upon selling the company's internet business, Yahoo will place its ownership stakes in Chinese internet giant Alibaba in a company called Altaba. That 15% stake in Alibaba is worth about $35 billion. Also part of Altaba will be Yahoo's more than one-third (35.5%) stake in Yahoo Japan.

"This transaction will accelerate Yahoo's operating business especially on mobile, while effectively separating our Asian asset equity stakes," Mayer said. "It is an important step to unlock shareholder value for Yahoo, and we can now move forward with confidence and certainty."

SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Kunal Madhukar called the price adjustment "modest in our view, amounting to only about $0.35 per share before tax," he said in a note to investors Tuesday. "The next step could be Yahoo filing a revised proxy statement that includes the amended purchase terms and potentially, a date for the shareholder vote."

Why Tesla Inc (TSLA) Will Punch Through the Ceiling Again This week will mark the first time that Tesla Inc (ticker: TSLA) reports quarterly earnings under its spanking-new moniker. That might sound like just an interesting bit of trivia, but there's a bit more to it than that.

Elon Musk's Tesla Motors switched over to simply Tesla at the start of the month in large part to reflect the fact that the company folded in solar energy services company SolarCity Corp. last year. The problem? That's about the only effect on Tesla that anyone is really sure of.

That's just one of a few important storylines that could weigh on TSLA stock heading into (and following) Tesla's fourth-quarter earnings report on Wednesday.

The numbers. Expectations for double-digit growth out of Tesla still are par for the course. The Wall Street estimate for revenues sits at $2.19 billion, up 25.6 percent from the same quarter last year. Meanwhile, analysts believe TSLA will produce a 43-cent loss -- but that would be less than half the 87 cents in red ink that Tesla produced in its previous fourth quarter.

[See: 6 Things to Know About Mark Zuckerberg's Manifesto.]

Tesla surprised Wall Street by posting a 14-cent GAAP profit (71 cents non-GAAP) in the third quarter, but investors shouldn't expect a similar performance out of Tesla this quarter. For one, Elon Musk made no bones about actively pushing the pedal to the floor in search of a third-quarter profit, with Tesla's CEO saying in an email that "the third quarter will be our last chance to show investors that Tesla can be at least slightly positive cash flow and profitable before the Model 3 reaches full production." It doesn't appear a similar effort took place in the fourth quarter.

Also, Tesla already reported its deliveries for the fourth quarter, and that number (22,200) came in 2,800 units short. Granted, that was due to "last-minute delays in transport or because the customer was unable to physically take delivery," but that still makes TSLA less likely to produce a fourth-quarter profit.

What about SolarCity? The thing about analyst estimates for the quarter is, most of them are based on Tesla Motors figures -- because most analysts aren't quite sure how to factor in SolarCity and its massive losses.

So while the consensus estimate is for a 43-cent adjusted loss, Bloomberg points out that estimates range anywhere between a $2.13 loss and a 10-cent profit. In the same report, it quotes Consumer Edge Research's James Albertine, reflecting much of the analyst community:

"We do not know how Tesla plans to report SolarCity results in the future and it remains unclear to us how peers are incorporating (or not incorporating) SolarCity into current estimates," he says. "We will await further details from management before rolling the solar panel business into our model."

Those who do have SolarCity's "contributions" factor in present some unattractive forecasts. JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s Ryan Brinkman recently maintained an "underweight" rating on TSLA stock, saying, "Our Tesla estimates appear materially changed, although this almost entirely stems from newly incorporating SolarCity's large non-GAAP losses." JPMorgan's 2017 profit estimate for Tesla is more than four times the consensus expectation for a $1.26 loss.

For the record, JPMorgan favors Ford Motor Co. ( F) and General Motors Co. ( GM) instead.

The Model 3. Analysts and investors alike will probably be much more interested in forecasts and forward-leaning comments from the company.

The biggest topic of interest should be the Model 3 -- Tesla's $35,000 electric vehicle that has driven excitement about the automaker's ability to compete in a mass-market fashion. And on that front, Musk has already stoked the fires by recently announcing that the company was going to retool its Freemont, California, factory for Model 3 production. This "will allow Tesla to begin Model 3 production later this year as planned and enable us to start the ramp towards 500,000 vehicles annually in 2018" -- a statement that encouraged TSLA stock investors who have become conditioned to expect delays and setbacks.

[See: 10 Ways to Buy Industrial Stocks.]

Perhaps just as importantly: "We do not anticipate this brief pause to have a material impact on our first-quarter production or delivery figures, as we have added production days to compensate." Between this, and the fact that a couple thousand expected fourth-quarter deliveries had to be pushed forward, Tesla also could be setting itself up for a boffo first-quarter outlook.

Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) Has Revealed It All In Its Chart The technicals for Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) have taken shape, and with them a comprehensive picture has emerged. This is the current state of play as presented by the current technical setup.

No trading or investing strategy can count itself as sound without a hardcore adherence to the examination of technical charts and data. This has been the historical and current basis for some of the biggest trading success stories in the markets and will continue so for a long time into the future.

(YHOO) has shown a marked change in trend levels over the course of recent market activity. Based on recent activity surrounding both the 50 and 200 SMAs, there s been a marked trend created which can be described as bullish.

The composite picture painted by the trends built around both SMAs has also created a measured analysis of current investor sentiment as the stock navigates upside and downside risk. The established market sentiment toward the stock has created a trading environment which can suitably be described as positive.

There has also been a knock-on effect as it relates to trading volume now reflected in weak real-time sentiment on the buying and selling curve; this has created in turn, indifference toward the stock as measured across a broad statistical mix of the general trading community.

As a composite and comprehensive tableau, the stock s position in the minds of the trading market reflects a broad analysis of technicals and inherent trends which underpin overall market-trading viability.

Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures are two very important leading indicators that help traders gauge overall movement of a particular stock; they act as boosters to technical analysis. Together they show in a measured way, whether or not a stock currently overbought or oversold. This indicator is crucial in determining whether traders are tipped toward the side of buying more of the stock, or doing the opposite and selling more of the stock. This is very important directional information necessary for making trading decisions. (YHOO) s current measure for its 14-day RSI is 64.08%; this is suggestive that on balance of the indicator, the stock is neutral   neither overbought nor oversold and therefore not susceptible to any undue price movements in either direction. The stochastic picture presents a complimentary view of overall sentiment in the present state for (YHOO). Stochastic data gathered over the last 30 days has created a score of 63.19%. This indicates that the stock is neither overbought or oversold at current levels.

Often the indicators laid out above do not communicate fully all that a trader needs to know. In these instances, reliance can be placed upon chart indicators that provide a view of short-term movement and/or long term performance. The omens depict a telling picture in terms of the near-term trading setup for (YHOO); this makes things very interesting to the curious and interested eye. The +1.29 has created a positive in the trailing 30 days since initiating movement. Over the extended term, the stock has outperform the S&P 500 by 26.05%. This consistent movement and its attendant overall performance have produced higher daily volatility when compared with other stocks ranking in the same peer group and on the same exchange. The picture looks the same when the stock is assessed against volatility levels measured historically. This historical volatility gives a current reading of 13.77%. These measures of historic volatility are very handy in judging the underlying price momentum and the rate of change in the price of (YHOO). Bound up this picture of volatility, is another measure that gives the underlying thesis for (YHOO). This can best be seen by analyzing the readings for the stock s average true range, currently 1.58. ATR is a fine augment to the other indicators outlined above and should be used in conjunction and not as a standalone. Trending Stocks: Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO), Activision Blizzard, Inc.

(YHOO) Makes Compelling Case Using Its Technical Chart Data Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has created a compelling message for traders in the most recent trading. That message has grown stronger as the technical chart setup has developed into a more composite picture for the stock. This is the breakdown as we see it. Many traders ask the question why technical charts should form the foundation of their trading strategy. For them, charts are too complicated, and quite often, unnecessary. But what could be worse than guessing? Technical charts take the guessing out of trading.

The 50 and 200 SMAs for YHOO have created a marked trend which is now helping traders to make solid decisions regarding the stock. It s a trend that is now unmistakable. Based on the trend levels presented by both indicators, the overall sentiment towards YHOO is best described as bullish. This trend has created a unified opinion across the trading floor and it is clear that the overall outlook for the stock is now established as positive. But it s not just the outlook that s being affected for the stock. Thanks to the consolidated opinion on YHOO, activity has also seen a pronounced trend. Under current sentiments the volume activity and subsequent trend has created a weak outlook from buyers and sellers. Sentiments have a tendency to either weaken or strengthen as other technical factors begin to influence overall outlook. It s interesting to see how things are playing out for YHOO. It is unsurprising in the case of YHOO, that the current trend has created some indifference among traders regarding the stock. In terms of consistency, it is clear that both the 50 and 200 SMAs have done their job in bring traders the overall trend-picture currently being seen for YHOO.

There is of course more to the tale than just what the SMAs have presented. For those added details, we can take a look at the Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures, both of which give deeper insights into the overall sentiment of buyers and sellers. SMAs will tell alert you to price direction, but when it comes to judging what buyers and sellers are doing, few indicators are better than RSI and the Stochastic. It as this level of technical data that a trader can determine whether a stock is currently overbought is oversold. The current picture for YHOO is of course very telling based on these two additional measures. Based on current readings, YHOO s 14-day RSI is 55.86%. Taken on the standard scale of measurement for RSI, this suggests that YHOO is neutral, suggesting that the stock is relatively stable in terms of price movement up or down. The stochastic reading offers another solid measure of whether the stock is either overbought, or oversold. In the case of YHOO, Stochastic readings gathered over the last 30 days have created a score of 60.10%. This suggests YHOO is neither overbought or oversold at prevailing levels.

The best strategy for using technical analysis is of course to layer on as many indicators as can fit within a singular structure   a point of view, if you like. The above indicators really start to shine when you boost them by adding other indicators into the mix. By this point in the analysis of YHOO, it is clear that other technical indicators are saying essentially the same things. Specifically the +0.79 has birthed a positive overall sentiment when measured over the previous 30 days or so of trading. Over the longer-term YHOO has outperform the S&P 500 by 9.89. This has, unsurprisingly, created higher volatility levels when compared with similar stocks of the same grade and class. Historical volatility is no less consistent. The historical volatility picture for YHOO is shown in the reading of 11.18%. YHOO has clearly shown its full hand by the overall input of these technical indicators. But there is one final measure that when added to the already rich mix, shows in full color what YHOO is doing. The indicator is the Average True Range, and based on the current 1.38 reading, YHOO is certainly worth paying attention to.

YHOO, like most stocks that presents the current technical picture, should be approached and traded accordingly. Why Investors remained confident on Hess Corporation (HES), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)?

Inc. (YHOO) We have gathered the technical data on Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), and see some interesting trends in the stock s behavior of late. In the end, it s all about what a stock does that matters. In the case of this particular stock, the chart tells quite a story at present.

YHOO has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.

For market timers, it s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 55.86%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock s last month of action shows a score of 60.10%. Based on a raw data interpretation, this perspective doesn t suggest either an overbought or oversold condition.

It should be noted that the overall volatility in the stock is worth gauging as well. In recent action, YHOO has made a move of +0.79 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 11.75%, and it s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 11.18%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.4%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.

As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the  golden ratio  of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $35.05 sits at $39.69. YHOO also has additional support below at the stock s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $41.95.

YHOO Recent Price Volatility



Before we cover the full analysis we make a quick alert here that Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) has seen its stock price move at a tumbling low level. We'll go through the details below -- but that's the lede -- the stock has been unusally quiet. If there was a post it note to summarize the stock movement in the last 30-days it would likely read "quiet time... too quiet?" The HV20 isverus the HV20 of the S&P 500 atAnother bit to this alert of, which we cover in the article, is that while the historical volatility may be a tumbling low level, the real question that needs to be answered for option traders is, but ratheraccuratley reflects what we're about to see in the stock for the next month.To jump forward and examine if owning or shorting options has been a positive trade in Yahoo! Inc, you can go here: Getting serious about option trading This is a proprietary realized volatility rating created by Capital Market Laboratories (CMLviz) based on a large number of data interactions for Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) . We examine the little used gem of daily stock volatility over a 20-day and 30-day trading period, as well as comparisons to the last year and the actual stock returns over the last three- and six-months and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices.As a heads up, in the "" sectionon Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) , we're going to take a step back and show really clearly that there is actuallyin successful option trading than most people are aware of. This idea of an "option trading expert" is vastly over complicated so those with the information advantage can continue to profit at the expense of the rest.But before that, let's turn back to YHOO. Here are the exact steps that led us to this rating, and whether it's a risk alert or a holding pattern.Price volatility using proprietary measures has hit a tumbling low level.Even though Yahoo! Inc is a legitimate large cap, just the fact that it is a technology company makes YHOO susceptible to elevated risk due to issues surrounding unrest in the European Union and patent fights as well as an unending need to drive innovation forward through proper research and development.We also note that YHOO has negative GAAP earnings in the last year which makes it ever more susceptible to stock volatility. Here is a rolling annual volatility chart of the biotech index (IBB) versus the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. Note how elevated the technology sector volatility is (the yellow curve) relative to the S&P 500.While stocks with YHOO's profile see a short-term quiet period, this is also one of those times when a shake out volatility move could be on the horizon. To that point, we do note that YHOO is showing unusally low volatility in the last month relative to its past. Let's take a deep dive into some institutional level volatility measures for Yahoo!

If You Lack Direction On Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), You Need to Read This With all other things going on, Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) has been on a run   rising 11.95 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Yahoo! Inc. a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.

Let s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment s value to increase over time. So is with Yahoo! Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $2.22 below YHOO s recent stock price. That s the optimistic view from Wall Street.

The stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 27.95% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.

The company s share price is down -1.97% from previous highs of around $47.19 per share on March 21, 2017. On the bright side, the company s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 38.37% since hitting lows of $35.05 on June 27, 2016.

Finally, from a technical perspective, there s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $45.86 and $46.07. In terms of pullbacks, $46.46 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Yahoo! Inc. RSI was seen at 53.08. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.

With these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for YHOO is 43.82. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses. )

14-day Williams %R for Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) moved to around 57.23. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.

Uber boycott didn't do much damage, initial data shows Uber has arguably had the roughest year of its 8-year existence, and it s only April. The company was beset by scandal after scandal, including what some considered tacit support of the White House s ban on refugees from predominantly Muslim countries, allegations of sexual harassment, questionably legal anti-regulation tactics, and more.

Starting in late January, the #deleteUber hashtag went viral and the company had to create a new part of their app they never thought to build a way for people to delete their account. (Previously, users had to contact the company.) Over 200,000 people deleted their Uber accounts by the first week of February.

With the viral nature of the anti-Uber sentiment, questions emerged about how much damage the viral campaign would actually do to the company, and what boons there might be for competitors like Lyft.

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has released the numbers for February they run on a two-month delay finally giving insight into the damage from the scandals in Uber s biggest market. The TLC report covers number of rides by taxis, limousines, and any other car-for-hire services, which include app-based services like Uber, Lyft, Juno, and Gett.

Without knowing March s data yet, it s too early to know the effects of many of the scandals, but the month following the #deleteUber campaign s beginning is on the books. There doesn t appear to have been much damage. Uber ridership numbers typically fluctuate, and trips were at a localized peak of around 272,000 per day when the hashtag began to trend on Jan. 28 and became most prevalent over the week following (President Trump issued the administration s first travel ban on Jan. 27).

View photos It s hard to say how much Uber was affected by #deleteUber in New York City. Source: TLC/Todd Schneiderman More

About a week later, trips were down 11%. Whether that was because of Uber s bad reputation or other factors random drops like this are commonplace due to weather and holidays is impossible to know. The point, however, becomes somewhat moot when, on Feb. 18, the numbers return to 270,000 rides per day. Uber appears to have been negligibly affected.

With so much noise in the system from demand naturally fluctuating, it s hard to attribute changes to a cause like #deleteUber). However, the TLC data, pulled and consolidated into a visualization above by data scientist Todd W. Schneider, shows an uptick in Lyft that appears to be statistically significant. On Jan. 28, the day #deleteUber was born, Lyft made 44,000 trips and by Feb. 4, they were at 59,000, a massive 44% jump during Uber s 11% decline. (Yellow cabs also experienced a jump during that period.)

Adding more detail is difficult. Lyft could have cannibalized new signups that would have otherwise gone to Uber, or riders could have simply used Lyft slightly more. It s impossible to say.

The TLC data is not current thanks to the lag period, so there isn t any data from March to provide further insight into any fallout (for example, from a different allegation against Uber). However, a survey published in late March and conducted by LendEDU, a student loan company, found that 93% of US millennials indicated they wouldn t stop using Uber despite the controversy surrounding the tech unicorn. The reasons? On the one hand, it works really well. But as one Uber rider told Yahoo Finance in the wake of the scandal, it s hard to turn down taxi rides subsidized by VC while they last.

Read More Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Has the U.S. Retail Sector Reeling As unbelievable as it sounds that one tech company could take down an entire sector of the U.S. economy, Amazon.com, Inc. (ticker: AMZN) may be single-handedly destroying U.S. retail. Retailers have seen the Amazon retail juggernaut coming for years, and yet the Amazon body count continues to rise.

This month, two more names could be added to the list. Shoe chain Payless just filed for bankruptcy, and teen retailer Rue 21 is reportedly planning to follow suit in coming weeks.

Amazon has been devastating traditional brick-and-mortar retailers for years. But while the retail industry struggles to adapt, things only seem to be getting worse.

[Read: How Investors Can Capitalize on the Growing Success of E-Commerce.]

Sears Holding Corp. ( SHLD) officials have acknowledged "substantial doubt" that its Sears and Kmart chains will continue.

U.S. retailers have already closed roughly 2,880 total stores so far in 2017 compared to only 1,153 store closings at this point last year. The total number of year-to-date closings puts the industry on a record pace in 2017.

Despite closing thousands of stores in recent years, popular mall retailers such as Macy's ( M) and J.C. Penney Co. ( JCP) will likely need to continue to aggressively reduce store counts.

"Cowen's proprietary top-down metropolitan statistical area analysis combined with a bottom-up point of view reveals closures of 20 percent or greater required at JCP & Macy's," Cowen & Co. analysts wrote in a new retail report.

Cowen predicts mall retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch ( ANF), Gap ( GPS) and Ascena Retail Group will "likely need to significantly reduce their store counts."

[Read: How 7 Big-Box Retail Stocks Are Faring.]

Cowen estimates off-mall retailers such as Kohl's ( KSS) may not require as many store closures.

The firm says retail investors should expect at least another 1,800 store closures in the near future.

The retail store closings have certainly been reflected in the U.S. employment numbers. The Department of Labor just reported that U.S. unemployment dropped to 4.5 percent in March, its lowest level in a decade. However, the retail sector reported a loss of 61,000 jobs in the past two months, its worst two-month stretch since 2009.

At the same time, Amazon announced in January that it plans to create 100,000 full-time U.S. jobs by mid-2018.

The Stochastic %K for TVIA is 4.73. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses. )

14-day Williams %R for TerraVia Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVIA) moved to around 94. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.

That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 15.47%, and the sector s average is 4.62%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -2.29% since hitting a peak level of $49.4 on Dec. 08, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 8.34% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 13.85% so far on the year   still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 71.2% higher from $28.76, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Jun. 15, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 28.01% for the past six months.

The bad news is analysts don t believe there s a room for the share price to move in the upward direction. At recent closing price of $48.22, BBY has a chance to give up $-0.97 or -2.01% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($47.25) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.9 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.57 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Best Buy Co., Inc. s EPS growth has been nearly -0.7%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 10.97%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Best Buy Co., Inc. s ROE is 26.57%, while industry s is 10.67%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 12.84%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. BBY s ROA is 8.82%, while industry s average is 4.24%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 6.51. Yahoo! Inc.

How to reduce the chances of getting dragged off your United flight A photo from United, shows how passengers are treated when they are not asked to leave the plane. Source: United

United Airlines (UAL)  deplaned  one of its paying passengers late Sunday, dragging him from his seat and down the aisle.

Airlines routinely overbook planes and pay people to take the next flight when necessary. On this particular flight, United needed four seats for employees hitching a ride. It offered $800 vouchers, but no one on the plane volunteered. Instead, United selected four passengers at random.

When one passenger didn t comply, United had three men forcibly remove him. And soon after, a video of the incident went viral giving United another round of bad press.

Despite the outrage expressed on social media, and by a concerned passenger in the video, United s actions indicated it considered itself in the right. The reason is simple: a half-pound stack of paper called the  contract of carriage. 

Like the terms of service agreements most people scroll through quickly and click  I agree,  the United contract of carriage is something you likely agreed to without reading or understanding, something that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently said can be trouble.

Airlines don t value economy customers as much

Under Rule 25 on page 35 if you print it out the agreement says exactly what happens if the flight is oversold.  If there are not enough volunteers, other Passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily,  the language reads. (Of course, the deplaned man was not denied boarding, he was already boarded.)

The language continues however, shining light on how these  other Passengers  are chosen. It s not random, it s  in accordance with UA s boarding priority.  That means that if you have a certain type of fare class you may not even know these exist a complex itinerary, status (e.g. gold or platinum), have checked in early, or have frequent flier card, you are less likely to be asked to take the next flight. Even if it s just a free frequent flier card that you never use, it might save you from being asked to leave.

For passengers looking to take advantage of the budget seats offered, this unspoken ranking and largely unknown class system is important to know. Though companies take great pains to say otherwise, if you paid less, you are not as valued a customer.

Chase s Sapphire Reserve is very worth it, even with its slashed bonus TS Patents claims Yahoo used patented technology without a license SAN FRANCISCO   A California company is suing Yahoo! Inc. and up to 50 employees of the company, citing alleged patent infringement.

TS Patents LLC filed a complaint on March 29 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the defendants alleging that they infringed several of his technology patents, namely for its Yahoo! Briefcase online features.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that it suffered damages from having its patents infringed. The plaintiff holds Yahoo responsible because the defendants allegedly continued to use plaintiff's patented technology without a license despite several attempts from the plaintiff to communicate with them.

The plaintiff requests a trial by jury and seeks permanent injunction against the defendant, compensatory damages, treble damages, all legal fees, interest and any other relief as this court deems just. The plaintiff is represented by J. James Li and Tony Abdollahi of Lilaw Inc. in Los Altos.

U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Case number 3:17-cv-01721-MEJ Will Amazon Prime (AMZN) Users Actually Watch NFL Games? Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN is making serious efforts to drum up some business in the live sports video streaming space.

This is evident from the recent news wherein the NFL granted the online retail giant the rights of streaming live 10 "Thursday Night Football" games to Amazon Prime members. The deal was valued at around $50 million.

However, it must be noted that this is not an exclusive rights package. NFL's big television partners, CBS, NBC and its own NFL Network, will split up coverage of the same 10 games for the traditional broadcast and cable television audience.

Coming to the price performance, over the last one year, shares of Amazon have been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 50.02% compared with the Electronic Commerce industry's gain of 43.28%.

NFL Games - Perk for the Prime Members

Amazon has been eyeing popular U.S. sports like baseball and basketball but most of the rights have been locked up by major broadcasters through long-term contracts. However, Amazon managed to secure the NFL deal, giving its Prime Members a chance to watch the the upcoming season of NFL live.

Although the NFL deal is of high profile, it will not be easy to assess how valuable it will actually prove to be for Amazon and if it will help in increasing its Prime subscribers? These questions will remain unanswered till the actual figures are out.

Going by last year's numbers, Twitter's TWTR foray into the NFL last year was not quite successful. The company did not report a healthy user growth or revenues as a result of the NFL deal. The average Twitter viewership for the 10 Thursday night games at any given minute was 266,000, compared with 15.8 million on broadcast and cable television.

Moreover, in 2015, Yahoo! Inc. YHOO paid $17 million to live stream NFL games in London. Yahoo's live stream, which played automatically on its homepage, reached an estimated 15.2 million viewers. However, the average viewership per minute was only 2.36 million.

Despite the past numbers not being so great, let us see if Jeff Bezoscanmake more money by offering more content to its Prime members. Movies, TV and now live sports could definitely make Prime a long-term power in the content business given that cable television's viability is declining every day.

Amazon Push in the Media Business

The online retail giant seems poised to keep pushing heavily into the media content business. Amazon already produces its own original television programming, which includes the Emmy Award-winning Transparent. Also, Amazon recently put Hollywood in the spotlight when Manchester by the Sea took home two Oscars.

Amazon's interest in sports goes back a long time. Last year, the company had apparently approached traditional TV networks, seeking game rights. The company has already looked into live rights for the NBA, soccer, surfing and Indian Premier League cricket. The NFL marks a giant win on a small scale. If Amazon can prove the viability of its NFL streaming, then other leagues and live sporting events could soon join the party.

We believe, any live sports streaming offerings will take Amazon Prime one step closer to being a must-have living room feature.

What about the Investors?

The Seattle-based company wants to give its Prime members not only more choices but also more reasons to keep paying the $99 annual fee that includes free two-day shipping, as well as other services.

The NFL is America's highest-grossing sports league, bringing in about billions of revenue every season. Amazon investors will be happy to welcome the cash cow that is American football, as the company will add to its revenue streams.

This deal is most likely going to be good news for Amazon investors in the long-run and will allow the company to further capitalize on its existing users and add new subscribers, expanding its revenue base.

Bottom Line

This plan to own live sports rights appears to be the next step with these global streaming video content services. It makes sense too. To assume that audiences in different countries solely want to watch cinema is incorrect. Getting the right to stream live sports is a smart way of attracting new international members. That said, the content always has to be of high quality in order to stay ahead of its competitors.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) said on Monday it would buy Straight Path Communications Inc (STRP.A), a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, for $1.25 billion in an all-stock deal as it aims to accumulate the airwaves it needs for a next generation network.

The deal shows how wireless carriers may be increasingly willing to pay lofty prices for assets they view as critical to 5G, which is expected to boast higher speeds and more capacity.

The network is widely considered to be a multibillion dollar opportunity, and wireless carriers do not have many acquisition targets that would give them the type of spectrum they need in preparation for the roll out. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications.

The No.2 U.S. wireless carrier said it would offer $95.63 per share, a premium of 162.1 percent over Straight Path's close on Friday. Straight Path's shares rose to $91.32 in afternoon trade, while AT&T's shares were marginally lower.

Millimeter wave spectrum is expected to play a large role in 5G networks. Both AT&T and rival Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) have been conducting 5G trials. Verizon is testing a 5G fixed wireless service with equipment maker Ericsson in 11 markets in the U.S. and expects a commercial launch as early as 2018. Meanwhile, AT&T said earlier this year that it had successfully completed tests with Nokia [NOKI.UL] that delivered its streaming video service DirecTV Now over a 5G connection using millimeter wave technology.

Earlier this year, AT&T said it was acquiring privately held FiberTower and its millimeter wave spectrum rights. It expects that deal to close by next January.

In February, Verizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, said it had closed on its acquisition of XO Communications' fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion, giving it access to millimeter wave spectrum.

Between FiberTower and Straight Path, AT&T should have a similar amount of spectrum as Verizon if not more, said Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche, in a note on Monday.

Shares of other telecom companies rose after the news as investors expect a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector this year. Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which has been amassing wireless spectrum licenses, was up 1.9 percent to $63.75 in afternoon trading.

Dish as well as Ligado Networks, the wireless satellite venture awaiting approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to use its spectrum for 5G purposes, are considered potential acquisition targets by industry analysts. Ligado is working with financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives, sources told Reuters in March.

Straight Path had said in January it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners to help explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets.

The company had also agreed in January to pay the FCC $15 million to settle a federal probe of claims that it had submitted false data to renew airwave licenses.

The tax-free deal, valued at $1.6 billion in total, includes liabilities and amounts to be remitted to the FCC, according to the January settlement terms. It is expected to close within a year, pending FCC review.

The deal with AT&T is supported by Straight Path's majority shareholder, Howard Jonas, who has entered into a voting agreement with the carrier in support of the transaction.

Evercore advised Straight Path on the deal and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP provided legal counsel, while AT&T was advised by Moelis & Co and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.

Hub Group, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Earnings Expectations OAK BROOK, Ill., April 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hub Group, Inc. (HUBG) announced today that, based on information known as of the date of this release, it expects diluted earnings per share for the first quarter ending March 31, 2017 to be in the range of 30 cents to 32 cents per share. The expected earnings include one-time costs of approximately $1.5 million or $0.03 per share, for due diligence and severance expenses.



The primary factor affecting earnings in the first quarter lies within our intermodal business line. We are experiencing a soft pricing environment due primarily to excess truck capacity and extraordinarily aggressive intermodal pricing. This is evident in a highly competitive bid season that is about 27% complete. The majority of our intermodal business reprices every year. When we released our 2016 year end results, we anticipated that intermodal pricing would begin to rise in 2017. Instead we are seeing greater downward pressure on intermodal pricing.

On the positive side, our truck brokerage and Unyson Logistics business lines continue to outperform last year. Hub segment truck brokerage revenue is expected to increase between 30% and 32% year-over-year in the first quarter. Unyson s pipeline is exceeding the growth levels we experienced in 2016. We expect Unyson revenue to be up between 20% and 22% year-over-year in the first quarter. These results confirm our strategy to diversify our product offerings.

 We believe the current intermodal pricing environment is an aberration that will improve as truck capacity becomes tighter and pricing becomes more rational. Intermodal will always be a major part of Hub s business. But through diversification, the inevitable cyclical rise and fall of intermodal prices will have less of an impact on earnings,  said Dave Yeager, Hub s Chairman and CEO.  We are working diligently to further diversify our product offerings through acquisitions. 

While we are intensifying our cost containment efforts, we will continue to make strategic investments in technology and people to strengthen our competitive position in the market.

FIRST QUARTER EXPECTATIONS

We expect revenue will increase between 10% and 12% in the first quarter compared to last year.

Projected gross margin will decrease between $6.7 million and $7.1 million driven by a decline in intermodal margin, partly offset by an increase in truck brokerage and logistics gross margin.

Estimated operating expenses will range between $84.2 million and $84.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.

We believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 37%.

FULL-YEAR 2017 OUTLOOK

We expect that our full-year 2017 diluted earnings per share will range from $1.60 to $1.80.

We intend to release first quarter earnings after the market closes on April 26, 2017.

Oath Is The New Entity That Will Run Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO), AOL, Sources Say At this particular moment, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) is still making efforts to complete the $US4.5 billion ($A5.9 billion) acquisition of Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO).There has been quite high talk in the air in the recent past with a lot of people talking about its decision and effort to dedicate its AOL operations to meld the much troubled internet company.

As a matter of fact, it is nothing unusual considering that most of the high end companies are usually making huge decisions to either save the company or to help it move towards the right direction and that of course refers to the achievement of great success.

Going by some of the top and trusted sources, Oath may soon be overseeing the completion of the deal. One interesting thing and which at the same time a lot of people are waiting to see how things play out in that regard is about the way the Yahoo and AOL brands will survive.

It was quite frustrating to some after Verizon showed reluctance in giving any leading details to clear the air around the matter as to what exactly were its plans in regard to Oath. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel considering that this summer it might have something tangible to tell the concerned parties.

The passage of time is carrying along numerous important revelations and the latest one in that regard was the tweet posted on Monday by AOL s top executive, Tim Armstrong. The top executive tweeted revealing that the underlying plans by oath which was preparing to manage about 20 different brands. As a matter of fact this was a good way to go provided the plans played out perfectly well.

According to a number of Verizon s top analysts, the company is investing much hope in the idea that combination of Yahoo and AOL might be the solution it needed to break through and become an industry leader.

This is not in anyway ruling out the fact that the two internet pioneers have in the recent past had to deal with much trouble in the past; however, it hopes the combination will go along way towards helping it sell more digital ads.

https://www.journaltranscript.com/disclaimer AOL's Armstrong: Some Yahoo brands get focus under Oath combo While Yahoo (YHOO +0.7% ) is joining in taking an Oath along with Verizon (VZ +0.1% ) media assets when the two companies are largely combined, key Yahoo brands will leverage existing equity and live on, says Tim Armstrong.

"The Oath brand is a brand that stays behind the scenes," says the AOL chief. "The real brands that we're going to be promoting are things like Yahoo, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, TechCrunch, Huffington Post."

Yahoo product users will get to keep using them, but likely see more Verizon cross-promotion, he says. Oh, and they'll have to change passwords more often. An investment in a "much deeper level of security" has already been approved.

The combined subscriber bases of Verizon and AOL/Yahoo could make the company the third-biggest player in targeted advertising, says Everest Group's Jimit Arora. Yahoo! Inc.

This is the current Zacks consensus EPS which was calculated at the time of writing. Analysts might review their estimates as they will get closer to the actual results date.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) share price decreased in the last trading session with a previous 52-week high of $47.19. The stock was trading on below-average volume. The stock traded at a volume of 4.76 million shares. The share price is now up 18.84% for the past three months. Latest closing price was 1.64% above its 50-day moving average and 10.20% above its 200-day moving average.

On 04/04/2017 close, QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE:QEP) rose 0.23% to $12.88. The stock currently has a Market Cap of $3.23B.

Price Target in Focus

Even though monitoring stock technical is significant, most stockholders are more apprehensive about where the stock might be going now. Equity research analysts have given opinions on where they foresees the stock level. According to Thomson Reuters, sell-side analysts are forecasting a harmony target price of $20.89 on company shares. This is a near-term estimation for the next 12-18 months.

While trading at volume above than average, QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE:QEP) previous 52-week high was $21.12 and moved down -3.81% over the same period, trading at a volume of 5.73 million. Shares have dropped -32.21% over the trailing 6 months. The stock is currently trading -14.22% below its SMA 50 and -26.26% below its SMA 200. In Good Financial Health?   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), Chevron Corporation (CVX) Shares of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) are on a recovery track as they have regained 31.9% since bottoming out at $35.05 on Jun. 27, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.73% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 19.55% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -2.03% from $47.19 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 21, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 26.97% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s shares projecting a $47.63 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 15.55%, and the sector s average is 4.61%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -7.82% since hitting a peak level of $119 on Jan. 03, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -3.99% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -6.8% so far on the year   still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 22.42% higher from $92.82, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Apr. 05, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 8.15% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $108.66, CVX has a chance to add $18.11 or 16.67% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($126.77) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.1 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.23 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Chevron Corporation s EPS growth has been nearly -15.1%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 61.3%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Chevron Corporation s ROE is -0.33%, while industry s is 9.18%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 9.95%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. CVX s ROA is -0.16%, while industry s average is 3.93%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 5.86.

Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) over the last three-years butwe get these findings:First we note that the short put strategy actually produced119.1% versus 40.3% or a 78.8% out-performance.Selling a put every 30-days in YHOO has been a pretty substantial winner over the last three-years returningEven better, the strategy has outperformed the short put that was held during earnings. Let's turn to that piece, now.Just doing our first step, which was to evaluate the short put while avoiding earnings is clever -- certainly an analysis that gets us ahead of most casual option traders. But let's take the analysis even further.This time, we will do the exact same back-test, but we will only look at earnings. Specifically, we will short the put two-days before earnings, let earnings happen, then close the option position two-days after earnings.Here are those results for the same 30 delta short put:While Selling an uncovered put in Yahoo! Inc during earnings did prove to be a winner, more importantly, itthan the same short put that avoided earnings. While this clever use of avoiding earnings has outperformed the short put that was held during earnings, there's a bigger picture here. Let's turn to that piece, now.

Canadian court delays decision on bail for Yahoo hacking suspect April 5 A Canadian court postponed making a decision on whether to grant bail to Karim Baratov, who was arrested in March on U.S. charges that he was involved in a massive hack of Yahoo email accounts, CBC reported Wednesday.

Baratov's lawyer requested that his client be released on bail, promising that he would remain at his parents' home in Hamilton, Ontario. The prosecutor argued the 22-year-old Kazakh-Canadian citizen was a flight risk and a threat to public safety.

Judge Alan Whitten said he would hold off on ruling until Tuesday, following a full-day hearing and private meeting with attorneys, according to a report on the website of Canadian public broadcaster CBC.

The United States has asked Canada to extradite Baratov to face charges that Russian intelligence agents paid him to break into email accounts, resulting in the 2014 theft of some 500 million Yahoo Inc YHOO.O accounts.

According to sources, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer will not be continuing with the new company that was declared recently prematurely in a tweet by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. The new Verizon-owned entity is called Oath   we ll get to mocking that name later in the post   and is the combination of AOL and Yahoo.

It will be headed by Armstrong, who is now apparently Oath-in-Chief.

Terms of Mayer s departure are still being worked through, but her not staying on is not much of a surprise. It will be interesting to see if she gets the full payout she is owed   tens of millions in severance and other kinds of remuneration that CEOs get larded into their contracts   after the recent hacking disaster and the general downturn in Yahoo s business during her four-year tenure.

Subprime auto are too small to be a big problem, says JP Morgan's Dimon Subprime loan delinquencies in the auto loan industry have triggered flashbacks of the financial crisis and Great Recession, and murmurs of concern have been growing louder. But at a joint town hall event put on by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Yahoo Finance, JPMorgan Chase s CEO Jamie Dimon gave a calming perspective when asked by an MBA student about potential bubbles forming in the markets. The exchange occurred about an hour and ten minutes into the video above.

 There s a problem with subprime auto, which we see,  said Dimon, whose bank offers auto lending through its consumer banking division.  But subprime auto is so small relative to the US debt market it won t make a difference to the system. 

According to Q4 2016 data from Experian, the subprime and deep subprime loans make up just a hair under 20% of the automotive finance market, up slightly from the 19% at the end of 2014. Current data shows delinquencies at 2.85% on auto loans, up from 2.62% a year earlier for 30-day delinquencies. For 60-day delinquencies, the rates had risen from 0.50% to 0.69% from Q4 2015 to Q4 2016. However, the trends haven t even always been downward throughout this period.

Whether these are meaningful increases or are relatively flat, Dimon and many other analysts are clear-headed: A problem may be coming, but not for the overall economy. Unlike mortgages, auto loans make up a small portion of the debt market.

A look at Federal Reserve data shows a remarkable difference between these two sectors. Mortgages make up around two-thirds of the market and auto loans are a slim 9%. In Dimon s view, if the domino falls, it s essentially going to fall against a wall.  It will cause issues somewhere but it won t be a problem,  he said.

Accused Yahoo hacker had Lamborghini, Aston Martin at 22 A Canadian accused of hacking Yahoo Inc. email accounts on behalf of the Russian government appeared in court seeking bail ahead of a hearing to determine whether he should be extradited to the U.S. for trial.

Karim Baratov, 22, was one of four people indicted by the U.S. government last month and charged with working for Dmitry Dokuchaev, a hacker for Russia's FSB security service. It's not clear whether Baratov knew he was working for the FSB.

The 2014 hack affected at least 500 million accounts at Yahoo, damaging the company's reputation and threatening a takeover bid from Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon cut its offer by $350 million to $4.48 billion following news of the breach.

Baratov, who was born in Kazakhstan and is a Canadian citizen, entered court in Hamilton, Ontario, wearing black sweatpants, black T-shirt, with his ankles chained. He put on a beige blazer as he sat down in the prisoner's box.

He told the court he lived with his parents until 2015. He said he had a Mercedes and a BMW while attending high school and started his own business protecting web servers from hackers in 2014. He said earned C$10,000 ($7,500) a month that year, less in the ensuing years.

At 20, Baratov said he moved into a C$642,000 home, and over time added a C$155,000 Lamborghini, a Porsche 911, an Aston Martin and another BMW to his car collection. His parents helped pay for the cars, he said.

Baratov said he had about C$260,000 of equity in his home when it was sold following his arrest. Baratov said he had no money in his personal bank account and about C$5,000 in his business bank account when he was arrested. Police found about C$31,000 in cash when they searched his home.

According to the U.S. government, Baratov was paid to gain access to 80 email accounts, including 50 Google accounts, belonging to Russian politicians and bureaucrats. He used spear-phishing attacks to target his victims, using fake emails to compel them to provide sensitive information, and would then sell their passwords to Dokuchaev for $100 each, according to the Justice Department.

The hackers were allegedly looking for people of political interest and others who might be vulnerable to financial fraud, and the list of victims included the White House and its military and diplomatic corps. They ultimately stole the contents of 6,500 Yahoo accounts in an attack the company called "state-sponsored."

The U.S. government is seeking to seize assets he is alleged to have obtained through illegal activity, including his black Mercedes Benz C54 and Aston Martin DBS.

Baratov's father offered to put up C$845,000 equity in his home, saying it represented his life's savings.

"It's not a risk," the father, Akhmet Tokbergenov, told the judge. "It's a great desire on my part and my wife's part to help him." A New Kind of Stock Chart: Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) Critical Pivot Points

A  Buy  rating does not mean that every investor should acquire the stock. Nor does a  Sell  rating mean that every investor should immediately sell it. Your own financial situation and investment needs are what matter.

JPMorgan Chase is teaming up with Intuit to make sure your financial data isn t being sold without your permission, since no one reads terms of service agreements. Source: AP

 You think you re studious? You re not,  JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon told a crowd of MBA students at a joint town hall put on by JPMorgan and Yahoo Finance.  How many of you use Mint, Google, Apple, Amazon, Digit, any one of those things. Raise your hands. 

The crowd raised their hands.

 When you pushed that button and said  I agree,  you have no idea what you agreed to. I do. 

Dimon s demonstration wasn t just a lesson in reading fine print to the young capitalists in the room. It was an illustration of how foggy the tech world can be when it comes to your data. When most people sign up for an app or service, they head straight for the  agree  button.

 A lot of you gave your bank passcodes away,  said Dimon.  Are you aware you gave your bank passcode away?  A lot can be thrown into an agreement you scroll through (or ignore completely), and since you can t negotiate or cross out terms of service, it s the company s way or the highway. Because disagreement is not an option if you want to use the app, companies have tremendous leeway to insert whatever terms they want. For example, agreeing to settle disputes in arbitration instead of court, or the ability for sites like Facebook or Google to sell your data.

Technically, it s with your permission, because you signed the terms of service.

According to Dimon, this blank check consumers give certain services means that big problems can occur when something goes wrong.  If you have $20,000 in a bank account and it s stolen from JPM, you re good. By law. If it s stolen another way, you re not or maybe not.  A big problem, he added, is that you may have given banks and integrated services the right to sell your data years ago.  They re still taking that data every day and they re selling it every day. Where you eat, what you did, what hotels you stayed in, all those various data you put in there,  Dimon said.

Today more third parties and apps integrate with banks and financial services to track expenses and help users budget. Dimon expects the agreements users sign to make this synergy possible will be more exposed to the light of day, instead of hiding in the fine print.  Eventually, you should be able to go on your mobile, look at the data that s being shared, and decide what to share, how to share it, when to share it so you can turn it off,  he said.

Dimon wasn t just complaining about unscrupulousness in his industry and issues with data and privacy, a theme that was in his 2015 letter. He was on message. In January, JPMorgan Chase and Intuit (INTU) announced a partnership to roll out these changes, giving consumers control over how their data is used.  I want to build something that s really good for the customer that you say  I love that. I control my data and you give me a way to turn it on and off,   he said.  So I think this is going to become a much bigger deal for the American public.
