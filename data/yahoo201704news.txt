(YHOO) Makes Compelling Case Using Its Technical Chart Data Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has created a compelling message for traders in the most recent trading. That message has grown stronger as the technical chart setup has developed into a more composite picture for the stock. This is the breakdown as we see it. Many traders ask the question why technical charts should form the foundation of their trading strategy. For them, charts are too complicated, and quite often, unnecessary. But what could be worse than guessing? Technical charts take the guessing out of trading.

The 50 and 200 SMAs for YHOO have created a marked trend which is now helping traders to make solid decisions regarding the stock. It s a trend that is now unmistakable. Based on the trend levels presented by both indicators, the overall sentiment towards YHOO is best described as bullish. This trend has created a unified opinion across the trading floor and it is clear that the overall outlook for the stock is now established as positive. But it s not just the outlook that s being affected for the stock. Thanks to the consolidated opinion on YHOO, activity has also seen a pronounced trend. Under current sentiments the volume activity and subsequent trend has created a weak outlook from buyers and sellers. Sentiments have a tendency to either weaken or strengthen as other technical factors begin to influence overall outlook. It s interesting to see how things are playing out for YHOO. It is unsurprising in the case of YHOO, that the current trend has created some indifference among traders regarding the stock. In terms of consistency, it is clear that both the 50 and 200 SMAs have done their job in bring traders the overall trend-picture currently being seen for YHOO.

There is of course more to the tale than just what the SMAs have presented. For those added details, we can take a look at the Relative strength indicator (RSI) and Stochastic measures, both of which give deeper insights into the overall sentiment of buyers and sellers. SMAs will tell alert you to price direction, but when it comes to judging what buyers and sellers are doing, few indicators are better than RSI and the Stochastic. It as this level of technical data that a trader can determine whether a stock is currently overbought is oversold. The current picture for YHOO is of course very telling based on these two additional measures. Based on current readings, YHOO s 14-day RSI is 55.86%. Taken on the standard scale of measurement for RSI, this suggests that YHOO is neutral, suggesting that the stock is relatively stable in terms of price movement up or down. The stochastic reading offers another solid measure of whether the stock is either overbought, or oversold. In the case of YHOO, Stochastic readings gathered over the last 30 days have created a score of 60.10%. This suggests YHOO is neither overbought or oversold at prevailing levels.

The best strategy for using technical analysis is of course to layer on as many indicators as can fit within a singular structure   a point of view, if you like. The above indicators really start to shine when you boost them by adding other indicators into the mix. By this point in the analysis of YHOO, it is clear that other technical indicators are saying essentially the same things. Specifically the +0.79 has birthed a positive overall sentiment when measured over the previous 30 days or so of trading. Over the longer-term YHOO has outperform the S&P 500 by 9.89. This has, unsurprisingly, created higher volatility levels when compared with similar stocks of the same grade and class. Historical volatility is no less consistent. The historical volatility picture for YHOO is shown in the reading of 11.18%. YHOO has clearly shown its full hand by the overall input of these technical indicators. But there is one final measure that when added to the already rich mix, shows in full color what YHOO is doing. The indicator is the Average True Range, and based on the current 1.38 reading, YHOO is certainly worth paying attention to.

YHOO, like most stocks that presents the current technical picture, should be approached and traded accordingly. Why Investors remained confident on Hess Corporation (HES), Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO)?

Inc. (YHOO) We have gathered the technical data on Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), and see some interesting trends in the stock s behavior of late. In the end, it s all about what a stock does that matters. In the case of this particular stock, the chart tells quite a story at present.

YHOO has been trading in a bearish trend, based on the relative levels of its 50-day and 200-day simple moving averages. This suggests that the broad sum of capital flow in the stock has been generally negative over the recent period. In terms of the relative level of interest afforded this stock among active participants in the market, relative volume measures have been weak, indicating apathy for the name by traders, investors, and money managers during the past month of action. This suggests something of the significance of other current technical measures as well.

For market timers, it s also important to take measure of the relative level of recent lift or pressure in the stock is it overbought or oversold? For that, we turn to RSI and stochastic measures. The 14-day RSI stands at 55.86%. That shows that the stock, according to a traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI indicator, is not particularly predisposed to a reactive price movement based on this measure If we look at the stochastic measure, the raw data over the stock s last month of action shows a score of 60.10%. Based on a raw data interpretation, this perspective doesn t suggest either an overbought or oversold condition.

It should be noted that the overall volatility in the stock is worth gauging as well. In recent action, YHOO has made a move of +0.79 over the past month. Over the trailing year, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500 by 11.75%, and it s gotten there by action that has been more volatile on a day-to-day basis than most other stocks on the exchange. The stock s recent movement has come on a historical volatility score of 11.18%, which represents the standard deviation of returns of a theoretical long position from a mean price during that period. On a daily basis over the past month, the average true range of the stock, as expressed in percentage terms, is 1.4%. That should give you a pretty good sense of the level of risk implied in a short-term trading approach in the stock with a stop-loss in place.

As it stands at present, the stock might find important action at key Fibonacci levels. Fibonacci levels are used by major Wall Street firm technical desks. The math is drawn from the Fibonacci series that defines growth systems by an interval increase characterized by steps divisible by the  golden ratio  of 61.8%. In this case, the critical 38.2% level drawn off the 52-weeklow of $35.05 sits at $39.69. YHOO also has additional support below at the stock s 200-day simple moving average, which sits at $41.95.

YHOO Recent Price Volatility



Before we cover the full analysis we make a quick alert here that Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) has seen its stock price move at a tumbling low level. We'll go through the details below -- but that's the lede -- the stock has been unusally quiet. If there was a post it note to summarize the stock movement in the last 30-days it would likely read "quiet time... too quiet?" The HV20 isverus the HV20 of the S&P 500 atAnother bit to this alert of, which we cover in the article, is that while the historical volatility may be a tumbling low level, the real question that needs to be answered for option traders is, but ratheraccuratley reflects what we're about to see in the stock for the next month.To jump forward and examine if owning or shorting options has been a positive trade in Yahoo! Inc, you can go here: Getting serious about option trading This is a proprietary realized volatility rating created by Capital Market Laboratories (CMLviz) based on a large number of data interactions for Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) . We examine the little used gem of daily stock volatility over a 20-day and 30-day trading period, as well as comparisons to the last year and the actual stock returns over the last three- and six-months and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices.As a heads up, in the "" sectionon Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) , we're going to take a step back and show really clearly that there is actuallyin successful option trading than most people are aware of. This idea of an "option trading expert" is vastly over complicated so those with the information advantage can continue to profit at the expense of the rest.But before that, let's turn back to YHOO. Here are the exact steps that led us to this rating, and whether it's a risk alert or a holding pattern.Price volatility using proprietary measures has hit a tumbling low level.Even though Yahoo! Inc is a legitimate large cap, just the fact that it is a technology company makes YHOO susceptible to elevated risk due to issues surrounding unrest in the European Union and patent fights as well as an unending need to drive innovation forward through proper research and development.We also note that YHOO has negative GAAP earnings in the last year which makes it ever more susceptible to stock volatility. Here is a rolling annual volatility chart of the biotech index (IBB) versus the Nasdaq 100 and the S&P 500. Note how elevated the technology sector volatility is (the yellow curve) relative to the S&P 500.While stocks with YHOO's profile see a short-term quiet period, this is also one of those times when a shake out volatility move could be on the horizon. To that point, we do note that YHOO is showing unusally low volatility in the last month relative to its past. Let's take a deep dive into some institutional level volatility measures for Yahoo!

If You Lack Direction On Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), You Need to Read This With all other things going on, Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) has been on a run   rising 11.95 percent in just three months. It looks like traders are happy with the stock. On the other side, analysts now consider Yahoo! Inc. a neutral, and a technical analysis of the stock is setting somewhat neutral outlook for now.

Let s talk about the gap between analyst price targets for the next 12 months and Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s current share price. Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment s value to increase over time. So is with Yahoo! Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $2.22 below YHOO s recent stock price. That s the optimistic view from Wall Street.

The stock has actually made strong gains in the past year, as the company has gathered a 27.95% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.

The company s share price is down -1.97% from previous highs of around $47.19 per share on March 21, 2017. On the bright side, the company s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 38.37% since hitting lows of $35.05 on June 27, 2016.

Finally, from a technical perspective, there s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $45.86 and $46.07. In terms of pullbacks, $46.46 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) price is pointing towards neither exit nor entry barriers, according to a technical analysis tool called the Relative Strength Index (RSI). Last session Yahoo! Inc. RSI was seen at 53.08. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock s momentum has carried it too far. An RSI reading above 80 indicates that a stock is overbought while anything below 20 is oversold.

With these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for YHOO is 43.82. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses. )

14-day Williams %R for Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) moved to around 57.23. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.

Uber boycott didn't do much damage, initial data shows Uber has arguably had the roughest year of its 8-year existence, and it s only April. The company was beset by scandal after scandal, including what some considered tacit support of the White House s ban on refugees from predominantly Muslim countries, allegations of sexual harassment, questionably legal anti-regulation tactics, and more.

Starting in late January, the #deleteUber hashtag went viral and the company had to create a new part of their app they never thought to build a way for people to delete their account. (Previously, users had to contact the company.) Over 200,000 people deleted their Uber accounts by the first week of February.

With the viral nature of the anti-Uber sentiment, questions emerged about how much damage the viral campaign would actually do to the company, and what boons there might be for competitors like Lyft.

The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has released the numbers for February they run on a two-month delay finally giving insight into the damage from the scandals in Uber s biggest market. The TLC report covers number of rides by taxis, limousines, and any other car-for-hire services, which include app-based services like Uber, Lyft, Juno, and Gett.

Without knowing March s data yet, it s too early to know the effects of many of the scandals, but the month following the #deleteUber campaign s beginning is on the books. There doesn t appear to have been much damage. Uber ridership numbers typically fluctuate, and trips were at a localized peak of around 272,000 per day when the hashtag began to trend on Jan. 28 and became most prevalent over the week following (President Trump issued the administration s first travel ban on Jan. 27).

View photos It s hard to say how much Uber was affected by #deleteUber in New York City. Source: TLC/Todd Schneiderman More

About a week later, trips were down 11%. Whether that was because of Uber s bad reputation or other factors random drops like this are commonplace due to weather and holidays is impossible to know. The point, however, becomes somewhat moot when, on Feb. 18, the numbers return to 270,000 rides per day. Uber appears to have been negligibly affected.

With so much noise in the system from demand naturally fluctuating, it s hard to attribute changes to a cause like #deleteUber). However, the TLC data, pulled and consolidated into a visualization above by data scientist Todd W. Schneider, shows an uptick in Lyft that appears to be statistically significant. On Jan. 28, the day #deleteUber was born, Lyft made 44,000 trips and by Feb. 4, they were at 59,000, a massive 44% jump during Uber s 11% decline. (Yellow cabs also experienced a jump during that period.)

Adding more detail is difficult. Lyft could have cannibalized new signups that would have otherwise gone to Uber, or riders could have simply used Lyft slightly more. It s impossible to say.

The TLC data is not current thanks to the lag period, so there isn t any data from March to provide further insight into any fallout (for example, from a different allegation against Uber). However, a survey published in late March and conducted by LendEDU, a student loan company, found that 93% of US millennials indicated they wouldn t stop using Uber despite the controversy surrounding the tech unicorn. The reasons? On the one hand, it works really well. But as one Uber rider told Yahoo Finance in the wake of the scandal, it s hard to turn down taxi rides subsidized by VC while they last.

Read More Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Has the U.S. Retail Sector Reeling As unbelievable as it sounds that one tech company could take down an entire sector of the U.S. economy, Amazon.com, Inc. (ticker: AMZN) may be single-handedly destroying U.S. retail. Retailers have seen the Amazon retail juggernaut coming for years, and yet the Amazon body count continues to rise.

This month, two more names could be added to the list. Shoe chain Payless just filed for bankruptcy, and teen retailer Rue 21 is reportedly planning to follow suit in coming weeks.

Amazon has been devastating traditional brick-and-mortar retailers for years. But while the retail industry struggles to adapt, things only seem to be getting worse.

[Read: How Investors Can Capitalize on the Growing Success of E-Commerce.]

Sears Holding Corp. ( SHLD) officials have acknowledged "substantial doubt" that its Sears and Kmart chains will continue.

U.S. retailers have already closed roughly 2,880 total stores so far in 2017 compared to only 1,153 store closings at this point last year. The total number of year-to-date closings puts the industry on a record pace in 2017.

Despite closing thousands of stores in recent years, popular mall retailers such as Macy's ( M) and J.C. Penney Co. ( JCP) will likely need to continue to aggressively reduce store counts.

"Cowen's proprietary top-down metropolitan statistical area analysis combined with a bottom-up point of view reveals closures of 20 percent or greater required at JCP & Macy's," Cowen & Co. analysts wrote in a new retail report.

Cowen predicts mall retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch ( ANF), Gap ( GPS) and Ascena Retail Group will "likely need to significantly reduce their store counts."

Cowen estimates off-mall retailers such as Kohl's ( KSS) may not require as many store closures.

The firm says retail investors should expect at least another 1,800 store closures in the near future.

The retail store closings have certainly been reflected in the U.S. employment numbers. The Department of Labor just reported that U.S. unemployment dropped to 4.5 percent in March, its lowest level in a decade. However, the retail sector reported a loss of 61,000 jobs in the past two months, its worst two-month stretch since 2009.

At the same time, Amazon announced in January that it plans to create 100,000 full-time U.S. jobs by mid-2018.

Despite the overall weakness in the retail sector, Cowen still sees growth opportunities for selective investors. Cowen expects "growth and share gains" from value retailers TJX Companies ( TJX), Ross Stores ( ROST), Burlington Stores ( BURL), Dick's Sporting Goods ( DKS) and Ulta Beauty ( ULTA).

Normally this spread should be in positive territory, indicating that analysts expect an investment s value to increase over time. So is with TerraVia Holdings, Inc.. The median target of analyst views collected by Yahoo Finance was as much as $1.07 below TVIA s recent stock price. That s the optimistic view from Wall Street.

The stock has actually made sharp losses in the past year, as the company has gathered a -78.15% return in the past twelve months. But even with this move, there is still plenty of room for the company to come back from a longer term perspective, and especially if we look to recent lows for the company as well.

The company s share price is down -593.02% from previous highs of around $2.98 per share on September 27, 2016. On the bright side, the company s share price has been on the rebound, up more than 275% since hitting lows of $0.4 on April 06, 2017.

Finally, from a technical perspective, there s a strong possibility that the stock could enter into a new bull market after finding strong support between $0.36 and $0.4. In terms of pullbacks, $0.47 level is the first resistance point. Technical analysis can help recognize key technical price levels in the stock. Investors can use these support and resistance levels to refine their entries and exits from stocks.

Last session TerraVia Holdings, Inc. RSI was seen at 25.19. RSI measures the speed and change of a stock price to warn investors when a stock s momentum has carried it too far.

With these kinds of figures it is worthy to note that TerraVia Holdings, Inc. (TVIA) has been put into a neutral territory, but there are few other spots to consider. The Stochastic %K for TVIA is 4.73. Stochastics is a momentum indicator that uses basic support and resistance levels and integrates with the trend to give accurate buy or sell signals to traders. For stochastics, readings below 20 are considered oversold and you would only take buy signals if the indicator is below that level. A value of 80 is considered overbought and sell signals occurring below that level would be ignored. This leads to longer trades and should result in fewer losses. )

14-day Williams %R for TerraVia Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:TVIA) moved to around 94. The interpretation of Williams %R is very similar to that of the stochastic oscillator, except that the stochastic oscillator has internal smoothing. The oscillator ranges from 0 to -100. No matter how fast a security advances or declines, Williams %R will always fluctuate within this range. Overbought and oversold levels can be used to identify unsustainable price extremes. Simply put, readings in the range of 80% to 100% indicate that the security is oversold while readings in the 0% to 20% range suggest it is overbought.

Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 15.47%, and the sector s average is 4.62%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Best Buy Co., Inc. (NYSE:BBY) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -2.29% since hitting a peak level of $49.4 on Dec. 08, 2016. Thanks to an increase of almost 8.34% in the past one month, the stock price is now outperforming with 13.85% so far on the year   still in strong zone. In this case, shares are 71.2% higher from $28.76, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Jun. 15, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 28.01% for the past six months.

The bad news is analysts don t believe there s a room for the share price to move in the upward direction. At recent closing price of $48.22, BBY has a chance to give up $-0.97 or -2.01% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($47.25) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.9 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.57 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Best Buy Co., Inc. s EPS growth has been nearly -0.7%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 10.97%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Best Buy Co., Inc. s ROE is 26.57%, while industry s is 10.67%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 12.84%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. BBY s ROA is 8.82%, while industry s average is 4.24%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 6.51. Yahoo! Inc.

How to reduce the chances of getting dragged off your United flight A photo from United, shows how passengers are treated when they are not asked to leave the plane. Source: United

United Airlines (UAL)  deplaned  one of its paying passengers late Sunday, dragging him from his seat and down the aisle.

Airlines routinely overbook planes and pay people to take the next flight when necessary. On this particular flight, United needed four seats for employees hitching a ride. It offered $800 vouchers, but no one on the plane volunteered. Instead, United selected four passengers at random.

When one passenger didn t comply, United had three men forcibly remove him. And soon after, a video of the incident went viral giving United another round of bad press.

Despite the outrage expressed on social media, and by a concerned passenger in the video, United s actions indicated it considered itself in the right. The reason is simple: a half-pound stack of paper called the  contract of carriage. 

Like the terms of service agreements most people scroll through quickly and click  I agree,  the United contract of carriage is something you likely agreed to without reading or understanding, something that JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently said can be trouble.

Airlines don t value economy customers as much

Under Rule 25 on page 35 if you print it out the agreement says exactly what happens if the flight is oversold.  If there are not enough volunteers, other Passengers may be denied boarding involuntarily,  the language reads. (Of course, the deplaned man was not denied boarding, he was already boarded.)

The language continues however, shining light on how these  other Passengers  are chosen. It s not random, it s  in accordance with UA s boarding priority.  That means that if you have a certain type of fare class you may not even know these exist a complex itinerary, status (e.g. gold or platinum), have checked in early, or have frequent flier card, you are less likely to be asked to take the next flight. Even if it s just a free frequent flier card that you never use, it might save you from being asked to leave.

For passengers looking to take advantage of the budget seats offered, this unspoken ranking and largely unknown class system is important to know. Though companies take great pains to say otherwise, if you paid less, you are not as valued a customer.

Chase s Sapphire Reserve is very worth it, even with its slashed bonus TS Patents claims Yahoo used patented technology without a license SAN FRANCISCO   A California company is suing Yahoo! Inc. and up to 50 employees of the company, citing alleged patent infringement.

TS Patents LLC filed a complaint on March 29 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the defendants alleging that they infringed several of his technology patents, namely for its Yahoo! Briefcase online features.

According to the complaint, the plaintiff alleges that it suffered damages from having its patents infringed. The plaintiff holds Yahoo responsible because the defendants allegedly continued to use plaintiff's patented technology without a license despite several attempts from the plaintiff to communicate with them.

The plaintiff requests a trial by jury and seeks permanent injunction against the defendant, compensatory damages, treble damages, all legal fees, interest and any other relief as this court deems just. The plaintiff is represented by J. James Li and Tony Abdollahi of Lilaw Inc. in Los Altos.

U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California Case number 3:17-cv-01721-MEJ Will Amazon Prime (AMZN) Users Actually Watch NFL Games? Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN is making serious efforts to drum up some business in the live sports video streaming space.

This is evident from the recent news wherein the NFL granted the online retail giant the rights of streaming live 10 "Thursday Night Football" games to Amazon Prime members. The deal was valued at around $50 million.

However, it must be noted that this is not an exclusive rights package. NFL's big television partners, CBS, NBC and its own NFL Network, will split up coverage of the same 10 games for the traditional broadcast and cable television audience.

Coming to the price performance, over the last one year, shares of Amazon have been steadily treading higher. The stock has returned 50.02% compared with the Electronic Commerce industry's gain of 43.28%.

NFL Games - Perk for the Prime Members

Amazon has been eyeing popular U.S. sports like baseball and basketball but most of the rights have been locked up by major broadcasters through long-term contracts. However, Amazon managed to secure the NFL deal, giving its Prime Members a chance to watch the the upcoming season of NFL live.

Although the NFL deal is of high profile, it will not be easy to assess how valuable it will actually prove to be for Amazon and if it will help in increasing its Prime subscribers? These questions will remain unanswered till the actual figures are out.

Going by last year's numbers, Twitter's TWTR foray into the NFL last year was not quite successful. The company did not report a healthy user growth or revenues as a result of the NFL deal. The average Twitter viewership for the 10 Thursday night games at any given minute was 266,000, compared with 15.8 million on broadcast and cable television.

Moreover, in 2015, Yahoo! Inc. YHOO paid $17 million to live stream NFL games in London. Yahoo's live stream, which played automatically on its homepage, reached an estimated 15.2 million viewers. However, the average viewership per minute was only 2.36 million.

Despite the past numbers not being so great, let us see if Jeff Bezoscanmake more money by offering more content to its Prime members. Movies, TV and now live sports could definitely make Prime a long-term power in the content business given that cable television's viability is declining every day.

Amazon Push in the Media Business

The online retail giant seems poised to keep pushing heavily into the media content business. Amazon already produces its own original television programming, which includes the Emmy Award-winning Transparent. Also, Amazon recently put Hollywood in the spotlight when Manchester by the Sea took home two Oscars.

Amazon's interest in sports goes back a long time. Last year, the company had apparently approached traditional TV networks, seeking game rights. The company has already looked into live rights for the NBA, soccer, surfing and Indian Premier League cricket. The NFL marks a giant win on a small scale. If Amazon can prove the viability of its NFL streaming, then other leagues and live sporting events could soon join the party.

We believe, any live sports streaming offerings will take Amazon Prime one step closer to being a must-have living room feature.

What about the Investors?

The Seattle-based company wants to give its Prime members not only more choices but also more reasons to keep paying the $99 annual fee that includes free two-day shipping, as well as other services.

The NFL is America's highest-grossing sports league, bringing in about billions of revenue every season. Amazon investors will be happy to welcome the cash cow that is American football, as the company will add to its revenue streams.

This deal is most likely going to be good news for Amazon investors in the long-run and will allow the company to further capitalize on its existing users and add new subscribers, expanding its revenue base.

Bottom Line

This plan to own live sports rights appears to be the next step with these global streaming video content services. It makes sense too. To assume that audiences in different countries solely want to watch cinema is incorrect. Getting the right to stream live sports is a smart way of attracting new international members. That said, the content always has to be of high quality in order to stay ahead of its competitors.

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc (T.N) said on Monday it would buy Straight Path Communications Inc (STRP.A), a holder of licenses to wireless spectrum, for $1.25 billion in an all-stock deal as it aims to accumulate the airwaves it needs for a next generation network.

The deal shows how wireless carriers may be increasingly willing to pay lofty prices for assets they view as critical to 5G, which is expected to boast higher speeds and more capacity.

The network is widely considered to be a multibillion dollar opportunity, and wireless carriers do not have many acquisition targets that would give them the type of spectrum they need in preparation for the roll out. Straight Path is one of the largest holders of 28 GHz and 39 GHz millimeter wave spectrum used in mobile communications.

The No.2 U.S. wireless carrier said it would offer $95.63 per share, a premium of 162.1 percent over Straight Path's close on Friday. Straight Path's shares rose to $91.32 in afternoon trade, while AT&T's shares were marginally lower.

Millimeter wave spectrum is expected to play a large role in 5G networks. Both AT&T and rival Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N) have been conducting 5G trials. Verizon is testing a 5G fixed wireless service with equipment maker Ericsson in 11 markets in the U.S. and expects a commercial launch as early as 2018. Meanwhile, AT&T said earlier this year that it had successfully completed tests with Nokia [NOKI.UL] that delivered its streaming video service DirecTV Now over a 5G connection using millimeter wave technology.

Earlier this year, AT&T said it was acquiring privately held FiberTower and its millimeter wave spectrum rights. It expects that deal to close by next January.

In February, Verizon Communications, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, said it had closed on its acquisition of XO Communications' fiber-optic network business for about $1.8 billion, giving it access to millimeter wave spectrum.

Between FiberTower and Straight Path, AT&T should have a similar amount of spectrum as Verizon if not more, said Wells Fargo analyst Jennifer Fritzsche, in a note on Monday.

Shares of other telecom companies rose after the news as investors expect a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the sector this year. Dish Network Corp (DISH.O), which has been amassing wireless spectrum licenses, was up 1.9 percent to $63.75 in afternoon trading.

Dish as well as Ligado Networks, the wireless satellite venture awaiting approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to allow it to use its spectrum for 5G purposes, are considered potential acquisition targets by industry analysts. Ligado is working with financial advisers to explore strategic alternatives, sources told Reuters in March.

Straight Path had said in January it was hiring investment bank Evercore Partners to help explore strategic alternatives, including a sale of assets.

The company had also agreed in January to pay the FCC $15 million to settle a federal probe of claims that it had submitted false data to renew airwave licenses.

The tax-free deal, valued at $1.6 billion in total, includes liabilities and amounts to be remitted to the FCC, according to the January settlement terms. It is expected to close within a year, pending FCC review.

The deal with AT&T is supported by Straight Path's majority shareholder, Howard Jonas, who has entered into a voting agreement with the carrier in support of the transaction.

Evercore advised Straight Path on the deal and Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP provided legal counsel, while AT&T was advised by Moelis & Co and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP.

Hub Group, Inc. Announces First Quarter 2017 Earnings Expectations OAK BROOK, Ill., April 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hub Group, Inc. (HUBG) announced today that, based on information known as of the date of this release, it expects diluted earnings per share for the first quarter ending March 31, 2017 to be in the range of 30 cents to 32 cents per share. The expected earnings include one-time costs of approximately $1.5 million or $0.03 per share, for due diligence and severance expenses.



The primary factor affecting earnings in the first quarter lies within our intermodal business line. We are experiencing a soft pricing environment due primarily to excess truck capacity and extraordinarily aggressive intermodal pricing. This is evident in a highly competitive bid season that is about 27% complete. The majority of our intermodal business reprices every year. When we released our 2016 year end results, we anticipated that intermodal pricing would begin to rise in 2017. Instead we are seeing greater downward pressure on intermodal pricing.

On the positive side, our truck brokerage and Unyson Logistics business lines continue to outperform last year. Hub segment truck brokerage revenue is expected to increase between 30% and 32% year-over-year in the first quarter. Unyson s pipeline is exceeding the growth levels we experienced in 2016. We expect Unyson revenue to be up between 20% and 22% year-over-year in the first quarter. These results confirm our strategy to diversify our product offerings.

 We believe the current intermodal pricing environment is an aberration that will improve as truck capacity becomes tighter and pricing becomes more rational. Intermodal will always be a major part of Hub s business. But through diversification, the inevitable cyclical rise and fall of intermodal prices will have less of an impact on earnings,  said Dave Yeager, Hub s Chairman and CEO.  We are working diligently to further diversify our product offerings through acquisitions. 

While we are intensifying our cost containment efforts, we will continue to make strategic investments in technology and people to strengthen our competitive position in the market.

FIRST QUARTER EXPECTATIONS

We expect revenue will increase between 10% and 12% in the first quarter compared to last year.

Projected gross margin will decrease between $6.7 million and $7.1 million driven by a decline in intermodal margin, partly offset by an increase in truck brokerage and logistics gross margin.

Estimated operating expenses will range between $84.2 million and $84.6 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.

We believe our effective tax rate will be approximately 37%.

FULL-YEAR 2017 OUTLOOK

We expect that our full-year 2017 diluted earnings per share will range from $1.60 to $1.80.

We intend to release first quarter earnings after the market closes on April 26, 2017.

Oath Is The New Entity That Will Run Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO), AOL, Sources Say At this particular moment, Verizon Communications Inc (NYSE:VZ) is still making efforts to complete the $US4.5 billion ($A5.9 billion) acquisition of Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO).There has been quite high talk in the air in the recent past with a lot of people talking about its decision and effort to dedicate its AOL operations to meld the much troubled internet company.

As a matter of fact, it is nothing unusual considering that most of the high end companies are usually making huge decisions to either save the company or to help it move towards the right direction and that of course refers to the achievement of great success.

Going by some of the top and trusted sources, Oath may soon be overseeing the completion of the deal. One interesting thing and which at the same time a lot of people are waiting to see how things play out in that regard is about the way the Yahoo and AOL brands will survive.

It was quite frustrating to some after Verizon showed reluctance in giving any leading details to clear the air around the matter as to what exactly were its plans in regard to Oath. However, there is some light at the end of the tunnel considering that this summer it might have something tangible to tell the concerned parties.

The passage of time is carrying along numerous important revelations and the latest one in that regard was the tweet posted on Monday by AOL s top executive, Tim Armstrong. The top executive tweeted revealing that the underlying plans by oath which was preparing to manage about 20 different brands. As a matter of fact this was a good way to go provided the plans played out perfectly well.

According to a number of Verizon s top analysts, the company is investing much hope in the idea that combination of Yahoo and AOL might be the solution it needed to break through and become an industry leader.

This is not in anyway ruling out the fact that the two internet pioneers have in the recent past had to deal with much trouble in the past; however, it hopes the combination will go along way towards helping it sell more digital ads.

https://www.journaltranscript.com/disclaimer AOL's Armstrong: Some Yahoo brands get focus under Oath combo While Yahoo (YHOO +0.7% ) is joining in taking an Oath along with Verizon (VZ +0.1% ) media assets when the two companies are largely combined, key Yahoo brands will leverage existing equity and live on, says Tim Armstrong.

"The Oath brand is a brand that stays behind the scenes," says the AOL chief. "The real brands that we're going to be promoting are things like Yahoo, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, TechCrunch, Huffington Post."

Yahoo product users will get to keep using them, but likely see more Verizon cross-promotion, he says. Oh, and they'll have to change passwords more often. An investment in a "much deeper level of security" has already been approved.

The combined subscriber bases of Verizon and AOL/Yahoo could make the company the third-biggest player in targeted advertising, says Everest Group's Jimit Arora. Yahoo! Inc.

Presently Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) stock have an ABR of 2.29. This is built on a simplified 1 to 5 scale where 1 represents a Strong Buy and 5 a Strong Sell. Looking ahead to earnings forecasts, for the running fiscal period, Wall Street analysts have anticipated that the company will report 0.08 earnings per share. This is the current Zacks consensus EPS which was calculated at the time of writing. Analysts might review their estimates as they will get closer to the actual results date.

Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) share price decreased in the last trading session with a previous 52-week high of $47.19. The stock was trading on below-average volume. The stock traded at a volume of 4.76 million shares. The share price is now up 18.84% for the past three months. Latest closing price was 1.64% above its 50-day moving average and 10.20% above its 200-day moving average.

On 04/04/2017 close, QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE:QEP) rose 0.23% to $12.88. The stock currently has a Market Cap of $3.23B.

Price Target in Focus

Even though monitoring stock technical is significant, most stockholders are more apprehensive about where the stock might be going now. Equity research analysts have given opinions on where they foresees the stock level. According to Thomson Reuters, sell-side analysts are forecasting a harmony target price of $20.89 on company shares. This is a near-term estimation for the next 12-18 months.

While trading at volume above than average, QEP Resources, Inc. (NYSE:QEP) previous 52-week high was $21.12 and moved down -3.81% over the same period, trading at a volume of 5.73 million. Shares have dropped -32.21% over the trailing 6 months. The stock is currently trading -14.22% below its SMA 50 and -26.26% below its SMA 200. In Good Financial Health?   Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO), Chevron Corporation (CVX) Shares of Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ:YHOO) are on a recovery track as they have regained 31.9% since bottoming out at $35.05 on Jun. 27, 2016. Meanwhile, due to an ongoing pressure which caused a decline of almost -0.73% in the past five days, the stock price is now up 19.55% so far on the year   still in strong territory. In this case, shares are down -2.03% from $47.19 , the 52-week high touched on Mar. 21, 2017, and are keeping their losses at 26.97% for the past 12 months.

Brokerage houses, on average, are recommending investors to hold Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) s shares projecting a $47.63 target price. What do this target means? Price targets reflect what the analyst believes a stock will be worth four quarters into the future. Are investors supposed to sell when the stock hits the target? Price targets frequently change, depending on the outlook for a company s earnings. Sometimes it may seem like it, but analysts don t just pull their price targets out of thin air. Typically, they estimate what the company s earnings and cash flow will be for the next couple of years, and then apply a ratio   such as a price-to-earnings ratio   to those estimates to determine what the future stock price should theoretically be.

YHOO s revenue has grown at an average annualized rate of about 0.7% during the past five years. However, the company s most recent quarter increase of 15.4% looks attractive.

While there are a number of profitability ratios that measure a company s ability to generate profit from the sales or services it provides, one of the most important is the net profit margin. It tells us what percentage of revenue a company keeps after all its bills are paid. While the higher this number is, the better, there is no gold standard. That s why this number shouldn t be looked at in isolation, but should be compared to a company s peer group as well as its sector. Currently, Yahoo! Inc. net profit margin for the 12 months is at -11.08%. Comparatively, the peers have a net margin 15.55%, and the sector s average is 4.61%. In that light, it seems in good position compared to its peers and sector.

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) is another stock that is grabbing investors attention these days. Its shares have trimmed -7.82% since hitting a peak level of $119 on Jan. 03, 2017. Meanwhile, due to a recent pullback which led to a fall of almost -3.99% in the past one month, the stock price is now with underperforming -6.8% so far on the year   still in weak zone. In this case, shares are 22.42% higher from $92.82, the worst price in 52 weeks suffered on Apr. 05, 2016, and are keeping their losses at 8.15% for the past six months.

The good news is there s still room for the share price to grow. At recent closing price of $108.66, CVX has a chance to add $18.11 or 16.67% in 52 weeks, based on mean target price ($126.77) placed by analysts.The analyst consensus opinion of 2.1 looks like a hold. It has a 36-month beta of 1.23 , so you might be in for a bumpy ride.

For the past 5 years, Chevron Corporation s EPS growth has been nearly -15.1%. Sure, the percentage is discouraging but better times are ahead as looking out over a next 5-year period, analysts expect the company to see its earnings go up by 61.3%, annually.

Two other important profitability ratios for investors to know are both returns-based ratios that measure a company s ability to create wealth for shareholders. They are return on equity and return on assets. Return on equity measures is a company s ability to turn an investor s equity into profit. The higher the return on equity, the better job a company is at optimizing the investment made on shareholders  behalf. Chevron Corporation s ROE is -0.33%, while industry s is 9.18%. The average ROE for the sector stands at 9.95%.

Return on assets, on the other hand, measures a company s ability to turn assets such as cash, buildings, equipment, or inventory into more assets. CVX s ROA is -0.16%, while industry s average is 3.93%. As with any return, the higher this number the better. However, it, too, needs to be taken into the context of a company s peer group as well as its sector. The average return on assets for companies in the same sector is 5.86.

As we look at Yahoo!

This is a risky strategy, but there is a clever way to reduce risk.

But let's take the analysis even further.This time, we will do the exact same back-test, but we will only look at earnings.

Canadian court delays decision on bail for Yahoo hacking suspect April 5 A Canadian court postponed making a decision on whether to grant bail to Karim Baratov, who was arrested in March on U.S. charges that he was involved in a massive hack of Yahoo email accounts, CBC reported Wednesday.

Baratov's lawyer requested that his client be released on bail, promising that he would remain at his parents' home in Hamilton, Ontario. The prosecutor argued the 22-year-old Kazakh-Canadian citizen was a flight risk and a threat to public safety.

Judge Alan Whitten said he would hold off on ruling until Tuesday, following a full-day hearing and private meeting with attorneys, according to a report on the website of Canadian public broadcaster CBC.

The United States has asked Canada to extradite Baratov to face charges that Russian intelligence agents paid him to break into email accounts, resulting in the 2014 theft of some 500 million Yahoo Inc YHOO.O accounts.

According to sources, Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer will not be continuing with the new company that was declared recently prematurely in a tweet by AOL CEO Tim Armstrong. The new Verizon-owned entity is called Oath   we ll get to mocking that name later in the post   and is the combination of AOL and Yahoo.

It will be headed by Armstrong, who is now apparently Oath-in-Chief.

Terms of Mayer s departure are still being worked through, but her not staying on is not much of a surprise.

Subprime auto are too small to be a big problem, says JP Morgan's Dimon Subprime loan delinquencies in the auto loan industry have triggered flashbacks of the financial crisis and Great Recession, and murmurs of concern have been growing louder. But at a joint town hall event put on by JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Yahoo Finance, JPMorgan Chase s CEO Jamie Dimon gave a calming perspective when asked by an MBA student about potential bubbles forming in the markets. The exchange occurred about an hour and ten minutes into the video above.

 There s a problem with subprime auto, which we see,  said Dimon, whose bank offers auto lending through its consumer banking division.  But subprime auto is so small relative to the US debt market it won t make a difference to the system. 

According to Q4 2016 data from Experian, the subprime and deep subprime loans make up just a hair under 20% of the automotive finance market, up slightly from the 19% at the end of 2014. Current data shows delinquencies at 2.85% on auto loans, up from 2.62% a year earlier for 30-day delinquencies. For 60-day delinquencies, the rates had risen from 0.50% to 0.69% from Q4 2015 to Q4 2016. However, the trends haven t even always been downward throughout this period.

Whether these are meaningful increases or are relatively flat, Dimon and many other analysts are clear-headed: A problem may be coming, but not for the overall economy. Unlike mortgages, auto loans make up a small portion of the debt market.

A look at Federal Reserve data shows a remarkable difference between these two sectors. Mortgages make up around two-thirds of the market and auto loans are a slim 9%. In Dimon s view, if the domino falls, it s essentially going to fall against a wall.  It will cause issues somewhere but it won t be a problem,  he said.

Accused Yahoo hacker had Lamborghini, Aston Martin at 22 A Canadian accused of hacking Yahoo Inc. email accounts on behalf of the Russian government appeared in court seeking bail ahead of a hearing to determine whether he should be extradited to the U.S. for trial.

Karim Baratov, 22, was one of four people indicted by the U.S. government last month and charged with working for Dmitry Dokuchaev, a hacker for Russia's FSB security service. It's not clear whether Baratov knew he was working for the FSB.

The 2014 hack affected at least 500 million accounts at Yahoo, damaging the company's reputation and threatening a takeover bid from Verizon Communications Inc. Verizon cut its offer by $350 million to $4.48 billion following news of the breach.

Baratov, who was born in Kazakhstan and is a Canadian citizen, entered court in Hamilton, Ontario, wearing black sweatpants, black T-shirt, with his ankles chained. He put on a beige blazer as he sat down in the prisoner's box.

He told the court he lived with his parents until 2015. He said he had a Mercedes and a BMW while attending high school and started his own business protecting web servers from hackers in 2014. He said earned C$10,000 ($7,500) a month that year, less in the ensuing years.

At 20, Baratov said he moved into a C$642,000 home, and over time added a C$155,000 Lamborghini, a Porsche 911, an Aston Martin and another BMW to his car collection. His parents helped pay for the cars, he said.

Baratov said he had about C$260,000 of equity in his home when it was sold following his arrest. Baratov said he had no money in his personal bank account and about C$5,000 in his business bank account when he was arrested. Police found about C$31,000 in cash when they searched his home.

According to the U.S. government, Baratov was paid to gain access to 80 email accounts, including 50 Google accounts, belonging to Russian politicians and bureaucrats. He used spear-phishing attacks to target his victims, using fake emails to compel them to provide sensitive information, and would then sell their passwords to Dokuchaev for $100 each, according to the Justice Department.

The hackers were allegedly looking for people of political interest and others who might be vulnerable to financial fraud, and the list of victims included the White House and its military and diplomatic corps. They ultimately stole the contents of 6,500 Yahoo accounts in an attack the company called "state-sponsored."

The U.S. government is seeking to seize assets he is alleged to have obtained through illegal activity, including his black Mercedes Benz C54 and Aston Martin DBS.

Baratov's father offered to put up C$845,000 equity in his home, saying it represented his life's savings.

"It's not a risk," the father, Akhmet Tokbergenov, told the judge. "It's a great desire on my part and my wife's part to help him." A New Kind of Stock Chart: Yahoo! Inc (NASDAQ:YHOO) Critical Pivot Points

JPMorgan Chase is teaming up with Intuit to make sure your financial data isn t being sold without your permission, since no one reads terms of service agreements. Source: AP

 You think you re studious? You re not,  JPMorgan (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon told a crowd of MBA students at a joint town hall put on by JPMorgan and Yahoo Finance.  How many of you use Mint, Google, Apple, Amazon, Digit, any one of those things. Raise your hands. 

The crowd raised their hands.

 When you pushed that button and said  I agree,  you have no idea what you agreed to. I do. 

Dimon s demonstration wasn t just a lesson in reading fine print to the young capitalists in the room. It was an illustration of how foggy the tech world can be when it comes to your data. When most people sign up for an app or service, they head straight for the  agree  button.

 A lot of you gave your bank passcodes away,  said Dimon.  Are you aware you gave your bank passcode away?  A lot can be thrown into an agreement you scroll through (or ignore completely), and since you can t negotiate or cross out terms of service, it s the company s way or the highway. Because disagreement is not an option if you want to use the app, companies have tremendous leeway to insert whatever terms they want. For example, agreeing to settle disputes in arbitration instead of court, or the ability for sites like Facebook or Google to sell your data.

Technically, it s with your permission, because you signed the terms of service.

According to Dimon, this blank check consumers give certain services means that big problems can occur when something goes wrong.  If you have $20,000 in a bank account and it s stolen from JPM, you re good. By law. If it s stolen another way, you re not or maybe not.  A big problem, he added, is that you may have given banks and integrated services the right to sell your data years ago.  They re still taking that data every day and they re selling it every day. Where you eat, what you did, what hotels you stayed in, all those various data you put in there,  Dimon said.

Today more third parties and apps integrate with banks and financial services to track expenses and help users budget. Dimon expects the agreements users sign to make this synergy possible will be more exposed to the light of day, instead of hiding in the fine print.  Eventually, you should be able to go on your mobile, look at the data that s being shared, and decide what to share, how to share it, when to share it so you can turn it off,  he said.

Dimon wasn t just complaining about unscrupulousness in his industry and issues with data and privacy, a theme that was in his 2015 letter. He was on message. In January, JPMorgan Chase and Intuit (INTU) announced a partnership to roll out these changes, giving consumers control over how their data is used.  I want to build something that s really good for the customer that you say  I love that. I control my data and you give me a way to turn it on and off,   he said.  So I think this is going to become a much bigger deal for the American public.
